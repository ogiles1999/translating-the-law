The flats in Settlers Court are held under long leaseholds. The lessees under such long leaseholds are granted the \"right to manage\" (the \"RTM\") by Part 2, Chapter 1 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (the \"2002 Act\"). The RTM permits them to take over management of the block of which their flats form part from the existing manager, whether the landlord or a third party, via a single purpose company (the \"RTM Company\"). The RTM Company formed by the lessees of the flats in Settlers Court obtained the RTM in respect of Settlers Court on 8 November 2014. That RTM Company is the First Respondent to the appeal. The other Respondents are lessees of flats in Settlers Court.The Estate contains other blocks of flats beyond Settlers Court. These other blocks share facilities and amenities with Settlers Court (the \"Estate Facilities\"). Prior to the lessees of Settlers Court exercising the RTM, the service of managing the Estate Facilities (the \"Estate Services\") was provided by a third party manager, the Appellant, for the benefit of the entire Estate. Under the terms of the relevant leases, the Appellant was entitled to levy charges from the lessees on the Estate in respect of providing the Estate Services (the \"Estate Charges\").A dispute arose between the parties over the extent of the RTM exercised by the lessees of Settlers Court. The Respondents claimed that the statutory RTM extends beyond Settlers Court so as to include the Estate Facilities. These were said to form part of the \"premises\" over which the RTM is exercisable. Consequently, the RTM Company, not the Appellant, was now responsible for providing the Estate Services to the lessees of Settlers Court and the Appellant was no longer entitled to levy the Estate Charges from them. Instead, once the RTM had been exercised, the Estate Charges in respect of Settlers Court, some 15.2% of the total for the Estate, became payable to the RTM Company not the Appellant.The Appellant disputed this, maintaining that it remained exclusively responsible for providing the Estate Services to the entire Estate because the RTM does not extend beyond the block over which it is exercised (and facilities and amenities solely relating to it). As such, it claimed to be entitled to continue to levy the Estate Charges from the lessees of Settlers Court, noting that it alone continued to provide the Estate Services to the entire Estate pursuant to its obligations under the long leases of flats in blocks other than Settlers Court, which remained in force on any view, and incurred the full costs of doing so.The parties were unable to reach agreement as to how the Estate Facilities should be managed and the Estate Charges levied. On 8 December 2017, the Appellant therefore applied to the First-tier Tribunal (the \"F-tT\") to determine whether it was entitled to levy Estate Charges from the lessees of the flats in Settlers Court. The F-tT found against the Appellant, considering itself bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal inGala Unity Ltd v Ariadne RoadRTM Co Ltd [2012] EWCA Civ 1372. In that case, the Court of Appeal had decided that the RTM did extend to facilities on an estate which were shared between the block of flats over which the RTM had been exercised and other dwellings, even though this would potentially leave both the RTM Company and the pre-existing manager responsible to different groups of lessees for providing the same services simultaneously. The Upper Tribunal (the \"UT\") dismissed the Appellant’s appeal on the basis that, amongst other things, it too was bound byGala Unity. The UT did however issue a leapfrog certificate for an appeal directly to the Supreme Court. This was the first time that the UT has issued such a certificate.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and, in doing so, holds that Gala Unity was wrongly decided. Lord Briggs gives the sole judgment with which all other members of the Court agree.Reasons for the JudgmentThe RTM grants the RTM Company the right to perform the relevant management functions over \"the premises\" to the exclusion of any other person such as the existing manager. Treating it as applying to shared common facilities raised insuperable problems [36]. The lessees of flats in blocks other than that over which the RTM has been exercised would be effectively disenfranchised by having shared Estate Services provided by an RTM Company with which they had no formal legal relationship. This would also be contrary to the terms of their leases and was the opposite of what the RTM under the 2002 Act was supposed to achieve[37]-[38].The statutory language in the 2002 Act, which had to be construed in light of the context and purpose of the Act, included numerous signposts pointing against the Estate Facilities forming part of the \"premises\" over which the RTM was exercisable. As such, the RTM could not grant the RTM Company the right or obligation to provide the Estate Services[39]-[49]. That construction of the 2002 Act was confirmed, but no more than that, by the Consultation Paper which accompanied the draft bill which later became the 2002 Act. This was admissible[51]-[53]. The particular facts ofGala Unityhad served to obscure the real difficulties created by the Court of Appeal’s decision in that case and the existence of overlapping rights to provide the Estate Services between a manager and an RTM Company[50].The scope of the RTM contended for by the Respondents would lead to outcomes, such as on the facts of the present case, which were both absurd and unworkable. The court would therefore lean against such a construction of the 2002 Act[54]. If the RTM Company was responsible for the Estate Services, it would be entitled to recover Estate Charges only from the lessees of the building in respect of which it had been set up. In this case that would mean only some 15% of the costs of providing the Estate Services could be recovered by the RTM Company. This would likely pose insurmountable solvency issues for it. Conversely, if the existing manager retained responsibility for providing the Estate Services, as it was bound to do under the terms of the leases held by the lessees of buildings other than that over which the RTM had been exercised, it could not recover the costs of doing so from the lessees who had exercised the RTM. In this case, that meant that, absent some agreement with the RTM Company, the Appellant, as manager, could recover only 85% of the costs of providing the Estate Services to the Estate as a whole[56]-[57]. Whilst in some cases the RTM Company and the manager might reach agreement, there was no obligation on an RTM company to do so. It was obviously preferable to interpret the 2002 Act in a way which did not lead to an unworkable situation absent such agreement[58].The RTM under the 2002 Act does not therefore extend to the RTM Company managing the shared Estate Facilities, which do not form part of the \"premises\" over which the RTM is exercisable. The Appellant remains the sole party responsible for providing the Estate Services to all lessees on the Estate and entitled to levy Estate Charges accordingly, including from the lessees of flats in Settlers Court[62].Gala Unitywas wrongly decided and should be overruled[63]. The appeal is therefore allowed.References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court’s decision.

In May 2017, the US Government made a request for his extradition to the US, where he is accused of committing an offence relating to securities fraud.The process for determining whether a person should be extradited from the UK is governed by the Extradition Act 2003 (\"the 2003 Act\"). By the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (\"the 2013 Act\"), Parliament inserted into the 2003 Act a number of provisions referred to as \"the forum bar provisions\". These provisions aim to prevent extradition where the offences could be fairly and effectively tried in the UK, and it is not in the interests of justice that the requested person should be extradited. Section 61 of the 2013 Act provides that the forum bar provisions will \"come into force on such a day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint\". The Secretary of State brought the forum bar provisions into force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in October 2013, but he did not bring them into force in Scotland.Mr Craig wanted to rely on the forum bar provisions in the extradition proceedings brought against him in Scotland. He therefore issued a claim against the Advocate General for Scotland and the Scottish Ministers, arguing that the Secretary of State’s failure to bring the forum bar provisions into force in Scotland was unlawful. In December 2018, the Outer House of the Court of Session found in Mr Craig’s favour and made an order in which it \"declared… that in its continuing failure to bring into force in Scotland the extradition forum bar provisions… the UK Government is acting unlawfully and contrary to its duties under section 61 of [the 2013 Act]\".Notwithstanding that order, the UK Government failed to bring the forum bar provisions into force in Scotland until September 2021. In the meantime, the Lord Advocate continued to pursue extradition proceedings against Mr Craig. In July 2019, a sheriff decided that there was no bar to Mr Craig’s extradition under the 2003 Act and that his extradition would be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (\"the Convention\"). The sheriff sent the matter on to the Scottish Ministers, who in September 2019 decided that Mr Craig should be extradited to the US.Mr Craig appealed, unsuccessfully, to the High Court of Justiciary. He now appeals to the Supreme Court.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. A new extradition hearing may be held before a different sheriff, at which Mr Craig will be able to rely on the forum bar provisions (in addition to any other arguments properly available to him).Lord Reed gives the sole judgment, with which the other Justices agree.Reasons for the JudgmentSection 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998 provides that a \"member of the Scottish Government has no power to… act, so far as the… act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights\"[25]. This means that the Lord Advocate has no power to conduct extradition proceedings against Mr Craig, and the Scottish Ministers have no power to order his extradition, if those acts are incompatible with Mr Craig’s rights under the Convention[37], [47].There is no dispute that the extradition of Mr Craig would interfere with his right to respect for his private and family life, as guaranteed by article 8(1) of the Convention. Such an interference could, however, be justified under article 8(2), if it is \"in accordance with the law\", if it pursues a \"legitimate aim\", and if it is \"necessary in a democratic society\". To satisfy the first of those three requirements, the interference must be in conformity with domestic law and the domestic law must meet the requirements of the rule of law, so as to afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness. This is an absolute requirement. The executive is afforded no margin of discretion in meeting it[48]-[50].The interference with Mr Craig’s rights under article 8(1) was not \"in accordance with the law\", within the meaning of article 8(2)[52]. The order made by the Outer House in December 2018 was expressed in the present tense, making clear that the Secretary of State was \"continuing\" to act in breach of section 61 of the 2013 Act by failing to bring the forum bar provisions into force. The Secretary of State had a duty to act in conformity with that order, and his failure to do so was unlawful[41]-[42]. The extradition procedure followed in Mr Craig’s case did not therefore accord with section 61 of the 2013 Act[52].It is no answer to this that the order made by the Outer House was merely declaratory, rather than coercive[43]. It is firmly established that there is a clear expectation that the Government will comply with declaratory orders, and it is in reliance on that expectation that the courts usually refrain from making coercive orders against the Government and grant declaratory orders instead[44]. This is one of the core principles of our constitution. It is vital to the mutual trust which underpins the relationship between the Government and the courts[46].Accordingly, the extradition proceedings against Mr Craig were not conducted \"in accordance with the law\" and so were incompatible with his rights under article 8 of the Convention. It follows that the extradition order made against him is invalid[53].References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court’s decision.
