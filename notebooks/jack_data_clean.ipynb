            "[{'judgement': {'body': 'Michaelmas Term [2009] UKSC 17 On appeal from: [2009] EWCA Civ 1048         JUDGMENT   S-B Children before   Lord Hope, Deputy President Lord Rodger Lady Hale Lord Brown Lord Collins Lord Kerr Lord Clarke    JUDGMENT GIVEN ON   14 December 2009  Heard on 25 and 26 November 2009  \\x0cAppellant Anthony Hayden QC Magdalen Case (Instructed by Dawson Cornwell)               Respondent Susan Grocott QC Sasha Watkinson (Instructed by Trafford Borough Council Legal and Democratic Services) 2nd Respondent Frances Judd QC Alexander Kloss (Instructed by Rowlands Solicitors)       \\x0c     LADY HALE  This is the judgment of the court.  1.   2. This  case  is  about  the  proper  approach  to  deciding  who  has  been responsible  for  harming  a  child  in  proceedings  taken  to  protect  that  child,  and others  in  the  family,  from  harm.  It  raises  profound  issues:  on  the  one  hand, children need to be protected from harm; but on the other hand, both they and their families  need  to  be  protected  from  the  injustice  and  potential  damage  to  their whole  futures  done  by  removing  children  from  a  parent  who  is  not,  in  fact, responsible for causing them any harm at all. The facts of this case present us with that dilemma in an unusually stark form.   The facts   3. Because we have decided to allow this appeal and send the case back to be decided  afresh,  we  should  say  only  enough  about  the  facts  to  explain  how  the dilemma arises. We shall use pseudonyms for the two children concerned, one who has  been  harmed  and  one  who  has  not.  Jason  was  born  on  19  May  2007.  On  15 June 2007, when he was just four weeks old, he was found to have bruising on his arms  and  face,  which  the  doctors  immediately  thought  was  caused  non-accidentally  and  not,  as  the  mother  suggested,  by  the  baby  pinching  himself  or sleeping on his dummy. Jason has not lived with his family since then, although he has had frequent and good quality contact with his mother.   4. Jason was living with his mother and father at the time and described by the doctors  as  “thriving”.  Both  parents  said  that  it  was  the  father  who  had  got  up  to attend  to  the  baby  when  he  woke  up  on  the  morning  when  the  bruises  were noticed. The mother took the baby to the clinic that morning and pointed them out to the health visitor. It was not possible to give precise timing for the bruises but it was  not  suggested  that  they  were  old  or of  different  ages.  They  could  have  been inflicted by both parents, but the judge found it more likely that only one of them had inflicted them. The bruises had not been there for so long, nor would they have caused the baby such pain and distress, that the other parent must have known that he was being harmed. This was not, therefore, a case where one parent had failed to  protect  the  child  from  harm  caused  by  the  other.  It  was,  colloquially,  a  pure “whodunit”.   5. The other child is William, born on 12 July 2008, while the proceedings to protect Jason were in train. By then the parents had separated, although they were  Page 2 \\x0c     still  in  touch  with  one  another.  The  father  had  stopped  visiting  Jason,  had withdrawn from co-operation with the social workers and with his solicitors, and played no further part in the proceedings. He has parental responsibility for Jason but not for William. William was removed from his mother shortly after birth and placed with the same foster carer as his brother. He has never been harmed. The case for removing him from his mother rests on the likelihood of his being harmed in the future if he is returned to her.   The law    6. In  this  country  we  take  the  removal  of  children  from  their  families extremely seriously. The Children Act 1989 was passed almost a decade before the Human  Rights  Act  1998,  but  its  provisions  were  informed  by  the  United Kingdom’s obligations under article 8 and article 6 of the European Convention on Human  Rights.  These  affect  both  the  test  and  the  process  for  intervening  in  the family lives of children and their parents.   7. As  to  the  test,  it  is  not  enough  that  the  social  workers,  the  experts  or  the court think that a child would be better off living with another family. That would be social engineering of a kind which is not permitted in a democratic society. The jurisprudence  of  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  requires  that  there  be  a “pressing social need” for intervention and that the intervention be proportionate to that  need.  Before  the  court  can  consider  what  would  be  best  for  the  child, therefore, section 31(2) of the 1989 Act requires that it be satisfied of the so-called “threshold conditions”:   “(a)  that  the  child  concerned  is  suffering,  or  is  likely  to  suffer, significant harm; and  (b) that the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to –   (i) the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were  not  made,  not  being  what  it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect  a parent to give to him; or  (ii) the child’s being beyond parental control.”   8. The leading case on the interpretation of these conditions is the decision of the  House  of  Lords  in  Re  H  (Minors)  (Sexual  Abuse:  Standard  of  Proof)  [1996] AC  563.  Three  propositions  were  established  which  have  not  been  questioned since. First, it is not enough that the court suspects that a child may have suffered  Page 3 \\x0c     significant harm or that there was a real possibility that he did. If the case is based on actual harm, the court must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the child was actually harmed. Second, if the case is based on the likelihood of future harm, the court must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the facts upon which  that  prediction  was  based  did  actually  happen.  It  is  not  enough  that  they may have done so or that there was a real possibility that they did. Third, however, if the case is based on the likelihood of future harm, the court does not have to be satisfied that such harm is more likely than not to happen. It is enough that there is “a  real  possibility,  a  possibility  that  cannot  sensibly  be  ignored  having  regard  to the nature and gravity of the feared harm in the particular case” (per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, at p 585F).   9. Thus the law has drawn a clear distinction between probability as it applies to past facts and probability as it applies to future predictions. Past facts must be proved  to  have  happened  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  is,  that  it  is  more likely  than  not  that  they  did  happen.  Predictions  about  future  facts  need  only  be based  upon  a  degree  of  likelihood  that  they  will  happen  which  is  sufficient  to justify preventive action. This will depend upon the nature and gravity of the harm: a  lesser  degree  of  likelihood  that  the  child  will  be  killed  will  justify  immediate preventive  action  than  the  degree  of  likelihood  that  the  child  will  not  be  sent  to school.    10. The House of Lords was invited to revisit the standard of proof of past facts in  Re  B  (Children)  (Care  Proceedings:  Standard  of  Proof)  [2008]  UKHL  35, [2009]  AC  11,  where  the  judge  had  been  unable  to  decide  whether  the  alleged abuse  had  taken  place.  The  suggestion  that  it  would  be  sufficient  if  there  were  a “real  possibility”  that  the  child  had  been  abused  was  unanimously  rejected.  The House  also  reaffirmed  that  the  standard  of  proof  of  past  facts  was  the  simple balance of probabilities, no more and no less.    11. The  problem  had  arisen,  as  Lord  Hoffmann  explained,  because  of  dicta which  suggested  that  the  standard  of  proof  might  vary  with  the  gravity  of  the misconduct  alleged  or  even  the  seriousness  of  the  consequences  for  the  person concerned  (para  5).  He  pointed  out  that  the  cases  in  which  such  statements  were made  fell  into  three  categories.  In  the  first  were  cases  which  the  law  classed  as civil but in which the criminal standard was appropriate. Into this category came sex  offender  orders  and  anti-social  behaviour  orders:  see  B  v  Chief  Constable  of Avon  and  Somerset  Constabulary  [2001]  1  WLR  340  and  R  (McCann)  v  Crown Court at Manchester [2002] UKHL 39, [2003] 1 AC 787. In the second were cases which  were  not  about  the  standard  of  proof  at  all,  but  about  the  quality  of evidence.  If  an  event  is  inherently  improbable,  it  may  take  better  evidence  to persuade the judge that it has happened than would be required if the event were a commonplace.  This  was  what  Lord  Nicholls  was  discussing  in  Re  H  (Minors),  Page 4 \\x0c     above, at p 586. Yet, despite the care that Lord Nicholls had taken to explain that having regard to the inherent probabilities did not mean that the standard of proof was  higher,  others  had  referred  to  a  “heightened  standard  of  proof”  where  the allegations were serious. In the third category, therefore, were cases in which the judges were simply confused about whether they were talking about the standard of  proof  or  the  role  of  inherent  probabilities  in  deciding  whether  it  had  been discharged. Apart from cases in the first category, therefore, “the time has come to say, once and for all, that there is only one civil standard of proof and that is proof that that the fact in issue more probably occurred than not” (para 13).   12. This  did,  of  course,  leave  a  role  for  inherent  probabilities  in  considering whether  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  an  event  had  taken  place.  But,  as  Lord Hoffmann  went  on  to  point  out  at  para  15,  there  was  no  necessary  connection between seriousness and inherent probability:   “It  would  be  absurd  to  suggest  that  the  tribunal  must  in  all  cases assume  that  serious  conduct  is  unlikely  to  have  occurred.  In  many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people,  it  would  make  no  sense  to  start  one’s  reasoning  by  saying that  assaulting  children  is  a  serious  matter  and  therefore  neither  of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the  question  for  the  tribunal  is  simply  whether  it  is  more  probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator.”   Lady Hale made the same point, at para 73:   “It may be unlikely that any person looking after a baby would take him  by  the  wrist  and  swing  him  against  the  wall,  causing  multiple fractures and other injuries. But once the evidence is clear that that is indeed  what  has  happened  to  the  child,  it  ceases  to  be  improbable. Someone looking after the child at the relevant time must have done it.  The  inherent  improbability  of  the  event  has  no  relevance  to deciding  who  that  was.  The  simple  balance  of  probabilities  test should be applied.”   13.  None  of  the  parties  in  this  case  has  invited  the  Supreme  Court  to  depart from those observations, nor have they supported the comment made in the Court of Appeal that Re B “was a ‘sweeping departure’ from the earlier authorities in the House  of  Lords  in  relation  to  child  abuse,  most  obviously  the  case  of  Re  H” ([2009]  EWCA  Civ  1048,  para  14).  All  are  agreed  that  Re  B  reaffirmed  the  Page 5 \\x0c     principles  adopted  in  Re  H  while  rejecting  the  nostrum,  “the  more  serious  the allegation, the more cogent the evidence needed to prove it”, which had become a commonplace but was a misinterpretation of what Lord Nicholls had in fact said.   14. Re B was not a new departure in any context. Lord Hoffmann was merely repeating  with  emphasis  what  he  had  said  in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home Department  v  Rehman  [2001]  UKHL  47,  [2003]  1  AC  153,  at  para  55.  A differently  constituted  House  of  Lords  applied  the  same  approach  in  Re  D (Secretary  of  State  for  Northern  Ireland  intervening)  [2008]  UKHL  33,  [2008]  1 WLR 1499.   15. In Re B, the House also declined an invitation to overrule the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re M and R (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Expert Evidence) [1996] 4 All ER 239. This was concerned with the stage after the court is satisfied that the threshold  has  been  crossed.  The  court  has  then  to  decide  what  order,  if  any,  to make. The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration: 1989 Act, s 1(1). In deciding whether or not to make a care or supervision order, the court must have regard  in  particular  to  the  so-called  “checklist”  of  factors:  1989  Act,  s  1(3),  (4). These include “(e) any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering”.   16. In Re M and R, the Court of Appeal determined that section 1(3)(e) should be interpreted in the same way as section 31(2)(a). The court must reach a decision based on facts, not on suspicion or doubts. Butler-Sloss LJ said this:   “[Counsel’s] point was that if there is a real possibility of harm in the past,  then  it  must  follow  (if  nothing  is  done)  that  there  is  a  risk  of harm in the future. To our minds, however, this proposition contains a non sequitur. The fact that there might have been harm in the past does not establish the risk of harm in the future. The very highest it can  be  put  is  that  what  might  possibly  have  happened  in  the  past means that there may possibly be a risk of the same thing happening in  the  future.  Section  1(3)(e),  however,  does  not  deal  with  what might possibly have happened or what future risk there may possibly be.  It  speaks  in  terms  of  what  has  happened  or  what  is  at  risk  of happening.  Thus,  what  the  court  must  do  (when  the  matter  is  in issue) is to decide whether the evidence establishes harm or the risk of harm.”   17. In agreeing with this approach in Re B, at para 56, Lady Hale commented that in such a case, “as indicated by Butler-Sloss LJ …, the ‘risk’ is not an actual risk to the child but a risk that the judge has got it wrong. We are all fallible human  Page 6 \\x0c     beings, very capable of getting things wrong. But until it has been shown that we have, it has not been shown that the child is in fact at any risk at all”. Re M and R was  also  approved  by  Lord  Nicholls  in  Re  O  and  another  (Minors)  (Care: Preliminary  Hearing)  [2003]  UKHL  18,  [2004]  1  AC  523,  a  case  to  which  we shall return.    18. The  House  in  Re  B  also  recognised  that  courts  and  local  authorities  have different roles to play in protecting children from harm. It is worth re-emphasising this,  given  the  understandable  concerns  in  the  wake  of  the  “Baby  P”  case  that social  workers  and  other  professionals  were  not  being  sufficiently  active  in  their protective  role,  and  the  resulting  increase  in  the  numbers  of  care  proceedings. Social workers are the detectives. They amass a great deal of information about a child  and  his  family.  They  assess  risk  factors.  They  devise  plans.  They  put  the evidence which they have assembled before a court and ask for an order.   19.  Article  6  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  requires  that  “In the determination of his civil rights and obligations, . . . everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law”. The court subjects the evidence of the local authority to  critical  scrutiny,  finds  what  the  facts  are,  makes  predictions  based  upon  the facts, and balances a range of considerations in deciding what will be best for the child. We should no more expect every case which a local authority brings to court to result in an order than we should expect every prosecution brought by the CPS to result in a conviction. The standard of proof may be different, but the roles of the social workers and the prosecutors are similar. They bring to court those cases where there is a good case to answer. It is for the court to decide whether the case is made out. If every child protection case were to result in an order, it would mean either  that  local  authorities  were  not  bringing  enough  cases  to  court  or  that  the courts were not subjecting those cases to a sufficiently rigorous scrutiny.    The “whodunit” problem   20. So far the position is plain. But the threshold criteria do not in terms require that the person whose parental responsibility for the child is to be interfered with or even taken away by the order be responsible for the harm which the child has suffered  or  is  likely  to  suffer  in  the  future.  It  requires  simply  that  “the  harm,  or likelihood of harm, is attributable to … the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect  a  parent  to  give  to  him”.  Clearly,  the  object  is  to  limit  intervention  to certain kinds of harm – harm which should not happen if a child is being looked after  properly.  But  is  it  also  intended  to  limit  intervention  to  cases  where  the  Page 7 \\x0c     person  whose  rights  are  to  be  interfered  with  bears  some  responsibility  for  the harm?   21. It cannot have been intended that a parent whose child has been harmed as a result of a lack of proper care in a hospital or at school should be at risk of losing her  child.  The  problem  could  be  approached  through  the  welfare  test,  because removal  from  home  would  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of  such  a  child.  However, because  of  the  risk  of  social  engineering,  the  threshold  criteria  were  meant  to screen  out  those  cases  where  the  family  should  not  be  put  at  any  risk  of intervention.  Hence  attention  has  focussed  on  the  attributability  criterion.  In  the case  confusingly  reported  in  the  Law  Reports  as Lancashire  County  Council  v  B [2000]  2  AC  147,  but  in  the  All  England  Law  Reports  as  Lancashire  County Council v A [2000] 2 All ER 97, the House of Lords considered what is meant by “the care given to the child”. Does it mean only the care given by the parents or primary carers or does it mean the care given by anyone who plays a part in the child’s  care?  Lord  Nicholls,  with  whom  Lord  Slynn,  Lord  Nolan  and  Lord Hoffmann agreed, found that it referred primarily to the former. But if, as in that case, the care of the child was shared between two households and the judge could not decide which was responsible for the harm suffered by the child, the phrase “is apt to embrace not merely the care given by the parents or other primary carers; it is  apt  to  embrace  the  care  given  by  any  of  the  carers”  (p  166).  Thus  the  criteria were  satisfied  in  respect  of  a  child,  A,  who  had  been  injured,  even  though  this might  have  been  attributable  to  the  care  she  had  received  from  her  childminder rather than from her parents.    22.   Lord Clyde put the test in this helpful way, at p 169C, with the same result:  “That  the  harm  must  be  attributable  to  the  care  given  to  the  child requires that the harm must be attributable to the acts or omissions of someone  who  has  the  care  of  the  child  and  the  acts  or  omissions must occur in the course of the exercise of that care. To have the care of a child comprises more than being in a position where a duty of care towards the child may exist. It involves the undertaking of the task of looking after the child.”     23.  However, it is worth noting that the Court of Appeal had confirmed that the criteria were not satisfied in respect of the childminder’s child, B, because he had not been harmed at all. The only basis for suggesting that there was any likelihood of harm to him was the possibility that his mother had harmed the other child and that had not been proved: Re H applied. The local authority did not appeal against this.       Page 8 \\x0c       25.   24. Re O and another (Minors)(Care: Preliminary Hearing) [2003] UKHL 18, [2004] 1 AC 523 was concerned with the more common problem, where the child has  been  harmed  at  the  hands  of  one  of  his  parents  but  the  court  cannot  decide which. The attributability condition was satisfied. Furthermore, when considering the  welfare  test,  the  court  had  to  proceed  on  the  basis  that  the  child  was  at  risk. Lord Nicholls, with whom all other members of the Committee agreed, said this, at para 27:    “Quite simply, it would be grotesque if such a case had to proceed at the  welfare  stage  on  the  footing  that,  because  neither  parent, considered  individually,  has  been  proved  to  be  the  perpetrator, therefore the child is not at risk from either of them. This would be grotesque  because  it  would  mean  the  court  would  proceed  on  the footing that neither parent represents a risk even though one or other of them was the perpetrator of the harm in question.”    Lord  Nicholls  went  on,  at  para  32,  to  give  the  following  guidance,  on  the assumption  that  the  hearing  would  be  split  into  a  “fact-finding”  and  a  “disposal” stage and that each might be heard by a different judge:   “.  .  .  the  judge  at  the  disposal  hearing  will  take  into  account  any views  expressed  by  the  judge  at  the  preliminary  hearing  on  the likelihood  that  one  carer  was  or  was  not  the  perpetrator,  or  a perpetrator,  of the circumstances, these views may be of considerable value in deciding the outcome of the application: for instance, whether the child should be rehabilitated with his mother.”  injuries.  Depending  on inflicted the In Re B, Lady Hale commented as follows at para 61: “The decisions in In re H, Lancashire County Council v B [2000] 2 AC  147,  and  In  re  O [2004]  1  AC  523  fit  together  as  a  coherent whole. The court must first be satisfied that the harm or likelihood of harm  exists.  Once  that  is  established,  .  .  .  ,the  court  has  to  decide what  outcome  will  be  best  for  the  child.  It  is  very  much  easier  to decide  upon  a  solution  if  the  relative  responsibility  of  the  child’s carers for the harm which she or another child has suffered can also be  established.  But  the  court  cannot  shut  its  eyes  to  the  undoubted harm which has been suffered simply because it does not know who was  responsible.  The  real  answers  to  the  dilemma  posed  by  those cases  lie  elsewhere  –  first,  in  a  proper  approach  to  the  standard  of  Page 9 \\x0c      proof,  and  second,  in  ensuring  that  the  same  judge  hears  the  whole case. Split hearings are one thing; split judging is quite another.”   26.  We are told that practice has now changed and that, barring accidents, the same  judge  does  conduct  both  parts  of  a  split  hearing.  Nevertheless,  the  main object of splitting the hearing is to enable facts to be found. If the threshold is not crossed, the case can be dismissed at that stage. If it is crossed, the professionals can  base  both  their  assessments  and  their  further  work  with  the  family  upon  the facts found. It is not at all uncommon for parents to become much more open with the professionals when faced with the judge’s clear findings based upon what the evidence shows. Hence there should always be a judgment to explain his findings at that stage.   These proceedings   27. It was necessary to give the above account of the development of the law in order to understand what happened in these proceedings. The case was originally identified as suitable for a split hearing; then it was decided to hold a composite hearing; but for regrettable practical reasons, the hearing was split once more. By that stage, the father was playing no part, but for some unknown reason the local authority decided not to issue a witness summons to require his attendance. That is regrettable  because  the  judge  might  well  have  found  it  easier  to  make  clear findings had he given evidence. The mother played a full part in the proceedings and  in  the  assessments,  but  only  accepted  that  the  bruises  were  non-accidentally caused after the possibility of a blood disorder had effectively been ruled out.   28. The judge heard evidence over three days in January 2008 and three further days in March. She handed down a detailed judgment in note form on 3 April. This was before the House of Lords’ decision in Re B. At the outset, under the heading ‘Test’, she directed herself as follows:   “The test I have applied in relation to these findings is that set out in the House of Lords case of [Re H] of 1996. The standard of proof I apply is on the balance of probability. The allegations in this case are very  serious  indeed  and  in  many  respects  are  also  very  unusual. When I apply the appropriate standard of proof, it has to be based on evidence  of  reliability  and  cogency  equivalent  to  the  gravity  of  the allegations.”   Page 10 \\x0c     29. She then listed five questions, three of which are relevant to the issue before this  Court:  first,  whether  the  child  had  suffered  non-accidental  injury;  second whether  the  perpetrator  could  be  identified;  and  third  “even  if  the  perpetrator cannot  be  identified,  can  either  of  the  parents  be  excluded  as  a  perpetrator?” However,  having  concluded  that  the  injuries  were  non-accidental,  she  did  not  in terms ask herself whether she could identify the perpetrator. She simply listed the various  factors  which  she  took  into  account  in  relation  to  each  parent.  She indicated at the outset of her list relating to the father that “there is a high index of suspicion  in  relation  to  the  father”  and  concluded  that  he  could  not  be  ruled  out. There was no such index in relation to the mother but for a variety of reasons the judge also concluded that the mother could not be ruled out.    30. The final hearing was listed for 5 June but could not proceed. As suggested in  Re  O,  the  judge  was  invited  to  give  an  indication  of  the  relative  likelihood  of father  or  mother  being  responsible  for  the  injuries,  in  order  to  assist  with  the assessment process. In oral exchanges she indicated that it was more likely that the father was the perpetrator than the mother. In a written “Adjunct to Judgment” she explained  that  “Invidious  though  it  is  to  be  too  specific,  but  to  help  further assessments, I am prepared to say that I feel it 60% likely that the father injured the child and 40% likely that it was the mother.”   31. The final hearing eventually took place before the same judge in December 2008 with judgment in January 2009. Part of the reason for the delay was that the mother had been unwell following the birth of her second child, William, in July. At the final hearing, the judge was invited to revisit her findings in the light of Re B,  in  which  judgment  was  given  on  11  June  2008.  She  declined  to  say  that  her finding meant that the father was the perpetrator of the injuries. She observed that:   “When  one  is  deciding  these  issues,  a  judge  frequently  reluctantly comes  to  the  conclusion  that  he  cannot  decide  who  is  to  blame between two parents or among more than two people who have had care of the child over the relevant period. However, although unable to  form  a  definitive  decision  to  the  requisite  standard,  a  judge  can still have an impression, falling short of a finding, that the propensity of the parties and the surrounding circumstances make it more likely that it was one party than another.”   Hence  the  mother  was  not  “absolved  as  a  really  possible  or  likely  perpetrator”. This meant that the threshold was crossed, not only in relation to the child who had suffered harm, but also in relation to the child who had not. The fact that there was a real possibility that she had caused the injuries to Jason meant that there was a real possibility that she would injure William.  Page 11 \\x0c     32.  After  considering  the  welfare  factors  she  concluded  that  the  mother’s vulnerable personality was such that she would need therapy in order to make the necessary  changes  so  that  she  could  provide  a  safe  and  stable  upbringing  for  the children.  Their  lives  could  not  be  put  on  hold  in  the  meantime.  Hence  the  judge approved  the  care  plan  to  place  them  both  for  adoption  and  made  care  and placement  orders  in  respect  of  both  children.  She  did,  however,  give  the  mother permission to appeal but this was not included in the original order drawn up by the court.   33. Lord  Justice  Wall  also  gave  permission  to  appeal,  observing  that  the  case “provides a useful opportunity for the Court of Appeal to resolve a point which has arisen  following  the  decision  of  the  House  of  Lords  in  Re  B,  namely  (1)  if  only parents  are  ‘in  the  frame’  for  having  injured  a  child  but  (2)  the  judge  cannot  as between  parents  identify  the  perpetrator  of  the  injuries,  can  that  judge  (3) apportion  likely  responsibility  between  them?”  Before  the  Court  of  Appeal, however, this was not the main issue. It was argued that, following Re B, the test for identifying the perpetrator was the balance of probabilities and that the effect of the “Adjunct to judgment” was that this judge had in fact identified the father. The appeal was dismissed: [2009] EWCA Civ 1048.   Identifying the perpetrator: the standard of proof   34. The first question listed in the statement of facts and issues is whether it is now settled law that the test to be applied to the identification of perpetrators is the balance  of  probabilities.  The  parties  are  agreed  that  it  is  and  they  are  right.  It  is correct,  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  observed,  that  Re  B  was  not  directly  concerned with the identification of perpetrators but with whether the child had been harmed. However, the observations of Lord Hoffmann and Lady Hale, quoted at paragraph 12 above, make it clear that the same approach is to be applied to the identification of  perpetrators  as  to  any  other  factual  issue  in  the  case.  This  issue  shows  quite clearly  that  there  is  no  necessary  connection  between  the  seriousness  of  an allegation and the improbability that it has taken place. The test is the balance of probabilities, nothing more and nothing less.       35.  Of course, it may be difficult for the judge to decide, even on the balance of probabilities, who has caused the harm to the child. There is no obligation to do so. As we have already seen, unlike a finding of harm, it is not a necessary ingredient of the threshold criteria. As Lord Justice Wall put it in Re D (Care Proceedings: Preliminary  Hearings)  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  472,  [2009]  2  FLR  668,  at  para  12, judges should not strain to identify the perpetrator as a result of the decision in Re B:   Page 12 \\x0c      “If  an  individual  perpetrator  can  be  properly  identified  on  the balance of probabilities, then . . . it is the judge’s duty to identify him or  her.  But  the  judge  should  not  start  from  the  premise  that  it  will only  be  in  an  exceptional  case  that  it  will  not  be  possible  to  make such an identification.”    36. There  are  particular  benefits  in  making  such  a  finding  in  this  context, especially where there is a split hearing. Miss Frances Judd QC, on behalf of the children’s guardian in this case, has stressed that the guardian would rather have a finding  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  than  no  finding  at  all.  There  are  many reasons for this. The main reason is that it will promote clarity in identifying the future risks to the child and the strategies necessary to protect him from them. For example, a different care plan may be indicated if there is a risk that the parent in question will ill-treat or abuse the child from the plan that may be indicated if there is a risk that she will be vulnerable to relationships with men who may ill-treat or abuse the child.   37.  Another  important  reason  is  that  it  will  enable  the  professionals  to  work with  the  parent  and  other  members  of  the  family  on  the  basis  of  the  judge’s findings.  As  the  Court  of  Appeal  said  in  Re  K  (Non-Accidental  Injuries: Perpetrator: New Evidence) [2004] EWCA Civ 1181, [2005] 1 FLR 285, at para 55:   “It  is  paradigmatic  of  such  cases  that  the  perpetrator  denies responsibility and that those close to or emotionally engaged with the perpetrator  likewise  deny  any  knowledge  of  how  the  injuries occurred. Any process, which encourages or facilitates frankness, is, accordingly, in our view, to be welcomed in principle.”   Often,  it  is  not  only  the  parents,  but  the  grandparents  and  other  members  of  the family, who may be the best resource to protect the child in the future but who are understandably reluctant to accept that someone close to them could be responsible for  injuring  a  child.  Once  that  fact  is  brought  home  to  them  by  a  clear  finding based upon the evidence, they may be able to work with the professionals to keep the child within the family.   38. the child, whatever the outcome of the proceedings:   Re K also suggested, at para 56, that there would be long term benefits for  Page 13 \\x0c     “.  .  .  we  are  also  of  the  view  that  it  is  in  the  public  interest  that children  have  the  right,  as  they  grow  into  adulthood,  to  know  the truth  about  who  injured  them  when  they  were  children,  and  why. Children  who  are  removed  from  their  parents  as  a  result  of  non-accidental injuries have in due course to come to terms with the fact that one or both of their parents injured them. This is a heavy burden for any child to bear. In principle, children need to know the truth if the truth can be ascertained.”   If the judge cannot identify a perpetrator?   39. The  second  and  third  questions  in  the  statement  of  facts  and  issues  ask whether  judges  should  refrain  from  seeking  to  identify  perpetrators  at  all  if  they are  unable  to  do  so  on  the  civil  standard  and  whether  they  should  now  be discouraged  from  expressing  a  view  on  the  comparative  likelihood  as  between possible perpetrators. These appear to be linked but they are distinct.   40.  As to the second, if the judge cannot identify a perpetrator or perpetrators, it is still important to identify the pool of possible perpetrators. Sometimes this will be necessary in order to fulfil the “attributability” criterion. If the harm has been caused  by  someone  outside  the  home  or  family,  for  example  at  school  or  in hospital  or  by  a  stranger,  then  it  is  not  attributable  to  the  parental  care  unless  it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it. Sometimes it will desirable for the same reasons as those given above. It will help to identify the real  risks  to  the  child  and  the  steps  needed  to  protect  him.  It  will  help  the professionals in working with the family. And it will be of value to the child in the long run.    41. In North Yorkshire County Council v SA [2003] EWCA Civ 839, [2003] 2 FLR  849,  the  child  had  suffered  non-accidental  injury  on  two  occasions.  Four people  had  looked  after  the  child  during  the  relevant  time  for  the  more  recent injury  and  a  large  number  of  people  might  have  been  responsible  for  the  older injury.  The  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  the  judge  had  been  wrong  to  apply  a  “no possibility”  test  when  identifying  the  pool  of  possible  perpetrators.  This  was  far too  wide.  Dame  Elizabeth  Butler-Sloss  P,  at  para  26,  preferred  a  test  of  a “likelihood or real possibility”.   42.  Miss  Susan  Grocott  QC,  for  the  local  authority,  has  suggested  that  this  is where confusion has crept in, because in Re H this test was adopted in relation to the  prediction  of  the  likelihood  of  future  harm  for  the  purpose  of  the  threshold criteria. It was not intended as a test for identification of possible perpetrators.   Page 14 \\x0c     43. That may be so, but there are real advantages in adopting this approach. The cases are littered with references to a “finding of exculpation” or to “ruling out” a particular  person  as  responsible  for  the  harm  suffered.  This  is,  as  the  President indicated, to set the bar far too high. It suggests that parents and other carers are expected to prove their innocence beyond reasonable doubt. If the evidence is not such  as  to  establish  responsibility  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  it  should nevertheless  be  such  as  to  establish  whether  there  is  a  real  possibility  that  a particular person was involved. When looking at how best to protect the child and provide  for  his  future,  the  judge  will  have  to  consider  the  strength  of  that possibility as part of the overall circumstances of the case.    44.  As to the third question, times have changed since Re O. Barring unforeseen accidents,  the  same  judge  will  preside  over  both  parts  of  the  hearing.  While  it  is helpful  to  have  a  finding  as  to  who  caused  the  injuries  if  such  a  finding  can  be made,  the  guardian’s  view  is  that  it  is  positively  unhelpful  to  have  the  sort  of indication  of  percentages  that  the  judge  was  invited  to  give  in  this  case.  Lord Justice Thorpe suggested, [2009] EWCA Civ 1048, para 17, that judges should be cautious about amplifying a judgment in which they have been unable to identify a perpetrator: “better to leave it thus”. We agree.   The unasked question   45. If the judge can identify a perpetrator on the balance of probabilities, what is to be done about the risk that he may be wrong and that some-one else was in fact responsible? We are indeed all fallible human beings. We can make mistakes, however hard we try to pay careful attention to the quality of the evidence before us and reach findings which are rationally based upon it.    46.  However, once the court has identified a perpetrator, the risk is not a proven risk to the child but a risk that the judge has got it wrong. Logically and sensibly, although the judge cannot discount that risk while continuing to hear the case, he cannot  use  it  to  conclude  that  there  is  a  proven  risk  to  the  child.  But  all  the evidence (if accepted by the judge) relating to all the risk factors that the judge has identified remains relevant in deciding what will be best for the child. And he must remain  alive  to  the  possibility  of  mistake  and  be  prepared  to  think  again  if evidence emerges which casts new light on  the  evidence  which  led  to  the  earlier findings. It is now well settled that a judge in care proceedings is entitled to revisit an earlier identification of the perpetrator if fresh evidence warrants this (and this Court  saw  an  example  of  this  in  the  recent  case  of  Re  I  (A  Child)  [2009]  UKSC 10).  The  guardian  also  submits  that  the  professionals  will  find  it  easier  to  work with this approach.        Page 15 \\x0c     47. It  is  important  not  to  exaggerate  the  extent  of  the  problem.  It  only  really arises in split hearings, which were not originally envisaged when the Children Act was passed. In a single hearing the judge will know what findings of fact have to be  made  to  support  his  conclusions  both  as  to  the  threshold  and  as  to  the  future welfare of the child. Moreover, cases rarely come as neatly packaged as this one does.  In  most  cases,  the  injuries  are  such  that,  even  if  one  parent  was  not responsible  for  causing  them,  she  was  undoubtedly  responsible  for  failing  to protect  the  child  from  the  person  who  did  cause  them.  In  many  cases,  there  are other risks to the child besides the risk of physical injury. The evidence which is relevant to identifying the perpetrator will also be relevant to identifying the other risks  to  the  child  and  to  assessing  what  will  be  best  for  him  in  the  future.  But clearly  the  steps  needed  to  protect  against  some  risks  will  be  different  from  the steps needed to protect against others. And the overall calculus of what will be best for the child in the future will be affected by the nature and extent of the identified risks. There are many, many factors bearing upon the child’s best interests and the identification of risks is only one of them.    The conclusion in this case   48.  We have every sympathy for the judge, who was only repeating the mantra which many other judges at every level had repeated in the past. But it is clear that she  did  misdirect  herself  on  the  standard  of  proof  at  the  fact-finding  hearing. Because she later said that she had simply been unable to decide, we do not think that  we  can  accept  the  invitation  of  Mr  Anthony  Hayden  QC,  on  behalf  of  the mother,  to  treat  her  “Adjunct  to  judgment”  as  a  finding  that  the  father  was  the perpetrator. That was not what she thought she was doing. However, that was an ex post facto rationalisation on her part. We cannot know what finding she would have made had she directed herself correctly in the first place. It is only right, for the sake of these children and their mother, that they should have the whole case put before a different judge who can decide the matter on the right basis.   49. There  is  a  further  reason  to  remit  the  case.  The  judge  found  the  threshold crossed in relation to William on the basis that there was a real possibility that the mother had injured Jason. That, as already explained, is not a permissible approach to a finding of likelihood of future harm. It was established in Re H and confirmed in Re O, that a prediction of future harm has to be based upon findings of actual fact  made  on  the  balance  of  probabilities.  It  is  only  once  those  facts  have  been found that the degree of likelihood of future events becomes the “real possibility” test  adopted  in  Re  H.  It  might  have  been  open  to  the  judge  to  find  the  threshold crossed in relation to William on a different basis, but she did not do so.     Page 16 \\x0c50. The case may look very different now that the mother’s life has moved on and in the mean time, thankfully, the children have been well protected from harm. The  appeal  is  therefore  allowed  and  the  case  remitted  for  a  complete  rehearing before a different judge.

The judge did not ask herself which parent was responsible, although she expressed the view that it was 60% likely that the father had injured the child and 40% likely that the mother had. The mother and father were separated and  the father played no part in the proceedings. At the later welfare hearing, the judge approved the placement of the child for adoption, together with his younger brother, who had been born during the proceedings and placed with foster parents soon after birth.

[8]-[13] It is clear from the observations of Lord Hoffman and Lady Hale in Re B that the same approach is to be applied to the identification of perpetrators as to any other factual issue in the case.

As  a  result  of  the  experience  of  the  pre-war  dictatorships,  the  right  to  free elections was emphasised during and immediately following the Second World War as an essential element of personal freedom and equality before the law. As Professor Hersch (later Sir Hersch) Lauterpacht put it in 1945:  “…  the  right  of  self-government  –  which  in  developed society means government by persons freely chosen by and accountable to the electors – is in itself an expression and a condition  of  freedom.  No  individual  …  is  free  if  he  is governed  against  his  will,  that  is,  if  the  persons  who exercise authority are not chosen by and accountable to the community at large.” (Lauterpacht, An International Bill of the Rights of Man (1945), 135)  2. Five years later Lauterpacht said:  “Without an  effective  guarantee of these political rights of freedom,  personal  freedom  and  equality  before  the  law must  be,  at  best,  precarious;  at  worst  they  may  be meaningless  …  The  insistence  on  an  International  Bill  of Rights  and  the  proclamation  of  the  enthronement  rights  of man  as  a  major  purpose  of  the  Second  World  War  were prompted by the experience of dictatorships the essence of which  was  the  denial  of  the  political  right  of  freedom.  … There is no intrinsic reason why the right to free, secret and periodic elections should not be … recognised by law and declared enforceable.” (Lauterpacht, International Law and Human Rights (1950), 281-2) 3. Consequently the right to free elections as an essential element of the developing international law of human rights was recognised in Lauterpacht’s own draft International Bill  of  the  Rights  of  Man  (Article  10),  in  the  American  Law  Institute’s  1944  draft Statement  of  Essential  Human  Rights  (Article  16),  in  the  Inter-American  Juridical Committee’s  1946  draft  Declaration  of  the  International  Rights  and  Duties  of  Man  Page 2 \\x0c           (Article XIII), and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly  in  1948  (Article  21(1)),  and  later  in  the  International  Covenant  on  Civil  and Political  Rights  (1966)  (Article  25)  and  the  American  Convention  on  Human  Rights (1969) (Article 23). The  Preamble  to  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  states  that 4. fundamental freedoms are best ensured by (inter alia) an effective political democracy. In Bowman v United Kingdom (1998) 26 EHRR 1, para 42, the European Court of Human Rights said: “Free elections and freedom of expression, particularly freedom of political debate, together form the bedrock of any democratic system.” In United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey (1998) 26 EHRR 121, para 45, it was said:   “Democracy is without doubt a fundamental feature of  the  European  public  order  ...  The  Preamble  goes  on  to affirm that European countries have a common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law. The Court has observed that in that common heritage are to be found  the  underlying  values  of  the  Convention;  it  has pointed out several times that the Convention was designed to  maintain  and  promote  the  ideals  and  values  of  a democratic society”.  5. The  First  Protocol  to  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  was  signed  in Paris on March 20, 1952. The Protocol was ratified by the United Kingdom in November 1952, and entered into force on May 18, 1954. By Article 3 of the Protocol: “Right to free elections The  High  Contracting  Parties  undertake  to  hold  free elections  at  reasonable  intervals  by  secret  ballot,  under conditions  which  will  ensure  the  free  expression  of  the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.” Background to the appeal 6. Sark is a small island in the Channel Islands, with a population of about 600. This appeal from the Court of Appeal (Pill, Jacob and Etherton LJJ: [2008] EWCA Civ 1319, [2009]  2  WLR  1205)  principally  concerns  the  application  of  Article  3  of  the  First Protocol to the constitutional changes introduced on Sark under the Reform (Sark) Law,  Page 3 \\x0c          2008 (“the Reform Law”) in relation to the composition of the Chief Pleas, which is its legislature (and also its executive). Under the Reform Law the members of the electorate (consisting of some 500 voters) each vote for 28 Conseillers, and the 28 candidates with the  largest  number  of  votes  are  elected.  After  approval  of  the  Reform  Law  by  Order  in Council, the first election of the 28 Conseillers took place on December 10, 2008. 7. Sir David Barclay and Sir Frederick Barclay, the first and second appellants (“the Barclay brothers”), own property on Sark. The third appellant, Dr Slivnik, lives on Sark and wants to stand for election to the Chief  Pleas. The appellants have two complaints. First, they claim that because of the position under the Reform Law of two office-holders and  prominent  members  of  the  community,  the  Seigneur  (or  Lord)  of  Sark  and  the Seneschal (or Steward), the Reform Law is incompatible with Article 3. Each of them is an ex officio, unelected, member of the Chief Pleas, and the Seneschal is the president of the  Chief  Pleas.  Neither  of  them  has  the  right  to  vote,  but  the  Seigneur  may  speak  in debate, and has the right of temporary veto of certain legislation. Second, the appellants claim that the Reform Law is incompatible with Article 3 (read alone or in conjunction with  the  prohibition  on  discrimination  in  Article  14  of  the  Convention)  because  Dr Slivnik is prevented from standing for election: as a resident he has the right to vote, but he is ineligible to stand because, as a citizen of Slovenia, he is an alien for the purposes of the Reform Law. Dr Slivnik also made a number of complaints about the conduct of the Seigneur and the Seneschal, but they are not relevant to the outcome of the appeal. The Channel Islands The Channel Islands consist of two Bailiwicks, Jersey and Guernsey. The Channel 8. Islands are Crown dependencies but they are not part of the United Kingdom nor are they colonies.  When  King  Philippe  Auguste  retook  possession  of  continental  Normandy  in 1204,  King  John  retained  the  Channel  Islands.  His  right  as  Duke  of  Normandy  lapsed, and  a  separate  title  grew  up  by  force  of  occupation,  which  attached  to  him  as  King  of England. This was confirmed by the Treaty of Bretigny in 1360. See Matthews (1999) 3 Jersey  L  Rev  177;  Minquiers  and  Ecrehos  Case  (France  v  United  Kingdom)  1953  ICJ Rep 47, 56-57. The Channel Islands are not represented in the United Kingdom Parliament. Acts 9. of Parliament do not extend to them automatically, but only if they expressly apply to the Islands  or  to  all  HM  Dominions  or  do  so  by  necessary  implication.  By  convention Parliament does not legislate for the Islands without their consent in matters of taxation or other  matters  of  purely  domestic  concern.  The  United  Kingdom  Government  is responsible for their international relations and for their defence. It is the practice for the Island  authorities  to  be  consulted  before  an  international  agreement  is  reached  which would apply to them.   Page 4 \\x0cSark            The  Crown  has  ultimate  responsibility  for  the  good  government  of  the  Islands. 10. The Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor (“the Secretary of State”), the first respondent, has departmental responsibility for the constitutional relationship between the Crown and the Channel Islands. The second respondent, the Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey, is a committee of the third respondent, the Privy Council. It is the practice  for  such  a  Committee  to  be  appointed  at  the  start  of  each  sovereign’s  reign  to deal  with  the  affairs  of  the  Channel  Islands.  The  Committee  consists  of  three  Privy Counsellors: the Secretary of State, a Minister in the Department of Justice, and the Lord President  of  the  Council.  The  Privy  Council’s  main  business  in  connection  with  the Islands is to deal with legislative measures submitted for ratification by Order in Council. The Crown acts through the Privy Council on the recommendation of the Committee. 11. In 1565, acting by letters patent, Queen Elizabeth I appointed Helier de Carteret as the Seigneur of Sark (or Lord of Sark), and granted it to him as a royal fief as a reward for his  having  secured  the  island  against  the  French.    Inheritance  of  the  fief  and  any  land sublet  by  the  Seigneur  is  by  male  primogeniture  in  the  manner  of  the  Crown.  The Seigneur  has  always  been  free  to  sell  the  fief  subject  to  royal  consent.  The  present Seigneur is John Michael Beaumont. His family acquired the fief with Crown permission in 1852. He inherited it on the death of his grandmother Dame Sibyl Hathaway in 1974. 12. The  letters  patent  granted  in  1565  required  the  Seigneur  to  keep  the  island continually  inhabited  or  occupied  by  40  men  who  had  to  be  English  subjects  or  swear allegiance  to  the  Crown.  To  achieve  and  to  maintain  the  island’s  defences,  Helier  de Carteret leased 40 parcels of land (known as “tenements”) at a low rent on condition that a house was built and maintained on each parcel and that “the Tenant” provided one man, armed  with  a  musket,  for  the  defence  of  the  island.  The  40  tenements  still  exist,  with minor boundary changes. There are 36 Tenants because some Tenants own more than one tenement. 13. In 1675 the office of Seneschal (or Steward) was created by the Crown. The main function  of  the  Seneschal  was  to  dispense  justice,  as  Sark’s  chief  judge.  The  present Seneschal is Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Guille MBE. Sark  is  part  of  the  Bailiwick  of  Guernsey,  but  has  a  large  measure  of 14. independence from Guernsey. The States of Guernsey may legislate for Sark on criminal matters without the consent of the Chief Pleas and on any other matter with their consent.  Page 5 \\x0c          The European Convention on Human Rights and Sark The European Convention on Human Rights provided in Article 63 (now Article 15. 56,  since  the  Eleventh  Protocol)  that  a  Contracting  State  could  declare  that  the Convention should extend to all or any of the territories for whose international relations it was responsible, with the effect that the provisions of the Convention would be applied in such territories “with due regard, however, to local requirements.” The Convention was extended in this way to the Bailiwick of Guernsey in 1953, and the First Protocol, which contains  a  similar  power  to  extend  in  Article  4,  was  extended  to  the  Bailiwick  of Guernsey in 1988. One of the questions canvassed on this appeal is whether the remedies under the 16. Human Rights Act 1998 are available to the appellants. In the course of the passage of the 1998  Act  the  House  of  Lords  rejected  an  amendment  to  apply  the  Act  to  the  Channel Islands  and  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  a  similar  amendment  was  withdrawn  in  the  House  of Commons:  Human  Rights  Law  and  Practice,  3rd  ed  2009,  ed  Lester  et  al,  para  2.22.4. Instead the Convention was applied by local legislation. The Human Rights (Bailiwick of Guernsey)  Law  2000  has  given  effect  to  Convention  rights  and  came  into  force  in November 2006.  Legislation in Sark The Chief Pleas legislates by two methods, Laws and Ordinances. It can legislate 17. for Sark on any matter by Projet de Loi, which requires the Royal Assent. After the Chief Pleas  passes  a  Law,  it  is  remitted  as  a  Projet  de  Loi  to  departmental  officials  at  the Ministry of Justice to be referred to the Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey for  its  consideration  and  report.  If  the  Committee  recommends  that  Royal  Assent  be granted, the Projet de Loi is presented to the next available meeting of the Privy Council, together with a report on any petitions which have been received. The Projet de Loi will not  go  to  the  Privy  Council  if  the  Committee  decides  not  to  recommend  it  for  Royal Assent.  Her  Majesty  in  Council  then  gives  Royal  Assent  (by  Order  in  Council)  to  any Projet  de  Loi  presented  by  the  Privy  Council  pursuant  to  a  recommendation  by  the Committee. She will also dismiss any petitions as appropriate. 18. The  evidence  in  these  proceedings  was  that,  in  considering  whether  or  not  to recommend  approval,  the  Committee  will  in  general  respect  the  decision  of  the  Chief Pleas,  and  there  would  tend  to  be  a  presumption  in  favour  of  recommending  Royal Assent. But consideration is given to the Crown’s responsibilities, so that if a Projet  de Loi  violates  the  Crown’s  international  obligations  or  any  fundamental  constitutional principle,  or  if  it  is  clearly  not  in  the  public  interest  for  it  to  become  law,  then  a recommendation may be made to withhold Assent.  Page 6 \\x0c            The Chief Pleas also legislates on a range of local affairs by Ordinance. The Royal 19. Court of Guernsey may annul an Ordinance on the ground that it is unreasonable or ultra vires  the  Chief  Pleas,  but  the  Chief  Pleas  may  appeal  to  the  Privy  Council  against  the annulment. The Seigneur had (and continues to have) power to veto an Ordinance, but it must 20. be placed before the Chief Pleas again (not more than 21 days later), and the Chief Pleas will  then  consider  whether  the  Ordinance  should  be  confirmed.  The  Seigneur  had  (and has) no power to veto Laws. Between  meetings,  the  business  of  the  Chief  Pleas  is  conducted  through  various 21. Committees which function in effect as the executive government of Sark.  The Reform (Sark) Law 1951 (“the 1951 Law”) Until  the  Reform  Law  became  law  in  2008,  the  majority  of  the  members  of  the 22. Chief Pleas were unelected Tenants, whose entitlement to sit derived from their status as landowners.  Until  1922  the  Seigneur  and  the  Tenants  were  the  only  members,  together with a Seneschal chosen by the Seigneur. The Sark Reform Law of 1922 introduced adult suffrage for the election of 12 People’s Deputies.  23. Under  the  1951  Law  the  Chief  Pleas  consisted  of  the  Seigneur,  the  Seneschal (who was appointed for a three year term of office by the Seigneur with the approval of the  Lieutenant  Governor  and  was  ex  officio  President  of  the  Chief  Pleas),  the  Tenants, and 12 Deputies of the People elected triennially.  In the case of a tenement jointly owned by  two  or  more  persons,  one  of  those  persons  was  appointed  as  the  Tenant,  by  those owners or a majority of them.  24. Both the Seigneur and the Seneschal had the right to vote in the Chief Pleas. The Seneschal was entitled, in the event of an equality of votes, to a casting vote in addition to his  original  vote,  but  following  McGonnell  v.  United  Kingdom  (2000)  30  EHRR  289 (involving  the  compatibility  of  the  judicial  functions  of  the  Bailiff  of  Guernsey  with Article  6(1)  of  the  Convention),  the  Seneschal  agreed  not  to  exercise  his  casting  vote pending further reform. Under the 1951 Law, aliens were not eligible to vote or stand for election to the 25. Chief Pleas.  Page 7 \\x0c         Reform process Sark  has  been  considering  constitutional  reform  since  1999.  In  March  2006,  the 26. Chief Pleas voted for a reform which would have provided for a legislature to consist of 16 Tenants elected by the Tenants and 16 Deputies elected by the rest of the population. In April 2006 the Chief Pleas withdrew its support for that option. On May 7, 2006, the Secretary of State (at that time Lord Falconer) wrote to the Seigneur to say that he was pleased with the decision of the Chief Pleas to withdraw the plan to reserve 16 seats in the Chief Pleas for Tenants because he “would not have been able to recommend for Royal Assent legislation about which there are serious or substantial ECHR compliance issues\". He said that “[a]ny option which falls short of a wholly democratic process would cause me  serious  difficulties.  ...  I  am  concerned  that  Sark  should  give  itself,  and  the  UK,  the best protection it can from ECHR challenge and its possible consequences … [i]t is the UK  which  is  vulnerable  to  an  ECHR  challenge.  The  UK  cannot  stand  by  and  give  that situation its tacit approval by doing nothing\". 27. In  April  2007,  the  Chief  Pleas  approved  another  version  of  a  new  law  which would still reserve seats in the Chief Pleas for Tenants, but with those Tenants elected by universal suffrage. The Secretary of State (by then Mr Jack Straw) decided not to submit that proposal to the Privy Council, because there were some aspects of the proposed law which  he  considered  not  to  be  unquestionably  compliant  with  international  law  and  the United Kingdom’s obligations, having regard to the Crown’s responsibility for the good government  of  the  Crown  Dependencies.  In  particular,  there  were  concerns  that  (a)  the composition of the legislature was not consistent with modern democratic principles; (b) the  dual  role  of  the  Seneschal  as  judge  in  Sark’s  sole  court  of  justice  and  President  of Chief Pleas might cast doubt on the judicial impartiality of a person subsequently called upon to determine a dispute concerning legislation with which he had been involved; and (c) the role of the Seigneur, his membership of the Chief Pleas and his wider functions, sat uneasily with democratic principles.  28. On February 21, 2008, the Chief Pleas approved a new version of a Reform Law. Under  that  Law,  the  reserved  seats  for  Tenants  are  removed.  The  Seigneur  and  the Seneschal  remain  members,  but  without  the  right  to  vote.  The  Seigneur’s  right  of temporary  veto  of  Ordinances  is  preserved.  The  Seneschal  can  now  only  speak  for  the purposes of exercising his role as President. Neither is now entitled to sit on Committees of the Chief Pleas. 29. The Barclay brothers presented several Petitions opposing the reform proposals as they  evolved,  and  in  particular  a  Petition  dated  March  3,  2008,  asking  that  the  Privy Council withhold approval of the Reform Law as enacted. The Petition complained, so far as  is  now  material,  that  (a)  in  violation  of  Article  3  of  the  First  Protocol,  the  Seigneur would be an unelected member of Chief Pleas, with a right to address it and with a power to veto Ordinances; (b) the membership of the Seneschal as President of Chief Pleas was  Page 8 \\x0c             incompatible  with  Article  3;  (c)  the  prohibition  on  non-British  nationals  standing  for election was incompatible with Article 3 and with Article 14 of the Convention. 30.  The Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey rejected the Petitions. The Schedule  to  an  Order  in  Council  dated  April  9,  2008  notes  that  the  Committee recommended  that  the  Petitions  be  dismissed  and  that  the  Reform  Law  should  receive Royal  Assent  at  the  next  meeting  of  the  Privy  Council  on  April  9,  2008.  The  Schedule then gave a summary of the Committee’s conclusions, which included: “The Reform Law would  not  violate  any  of  the  Crown\\'s  international  obligations,  and  that  therefore  those international obligations provided no basis for refusing Royal Assent\". The following are the principal features of the Reform Law which are relevant on The Reform Law  31. this appeal. The Chief Pleas 32. All  legislative  and  executive  functions  which  may  be  exercised  within  Sark  are exercisable by the Chief Pleas, or by the relevant Committee of the Chief Pleas or other body on which the function is imposed or conferred: section 1. The  Chief  Pleas  consists  of  the  Seigneur,  the  Seneschal,  and  28  elected 33. Conseillers, with elections to take place every fourth year: section 21(1). The number of Conseillers may be varied by ordinance: section 21(5).  34. A person is entitled to have his name inscribed in the register of electors if he is ordinarily  resident  in  Sark  and  has  been  for  12  months:  section  28(4).  A  person  who  is registered  in  the  Cadastre  (rating  register)  as  the  possessor  of  real  property  in  Sark  is deemed  to  be  ordinarily  resident:  section  28(5).  A  person  is  eligible  to  be  elected  a Conseiller if he is entitled to vote and “he is not an alien within the meaning of the law in force  in  the  United  Kingdom”  (section  28(3)(b)).  By  section  50(1)  of  the  British Nationality Act 1981, an “alien” is: “a person who is neither a Commonwealth citizen nor a British protected person nor a citizen of the Republic of Ireland”.  Page 9 \\x0c          Both the Seigneur and the Seneschal are now prohibited from being members of a 35. Committee of the Chief Pleas: section 45(3). Thus, neither can be directly concerned in the day-to-day running of Sark’s Executive Government. The 1951 Law did not prevent the Seneschal and the Seigneur from sitting on executive Committees of Chief Pleas, and they exercised their right to do so. The Seigneur 36. The Seigneur is a member of the Chief Pleas: section 21(1)(a). The Seigneur has the right to speak at any meeting of the Chief Pleas but does not have the right to vote: section 35(3). He cannot be a member of a Committee of the Chief Pleas: section 45(3). The  Seigneur  has  the  power  temporarily  to  veto  Ordinances  made  by  the  Chief 37. Pleas. Section 38 provides: “(1) Subject  to  subsections  (2)  and  (3),  the  Seigneur  may,  during  any  meeting  of  the  Chief  Pleas  at which  an  Ordinance  is  made,  veto  any  Ordinance  made  at that meeting.   (2)  Where  an  Ordinance  has  been  vetoed pursuant  to  subsection  (1),  it  shall  not  be  registered  but shall again be laid before the Chief Pleas not earlier than 10 days, and not later than 21 days, after the meeting at which it was made. (3)  Where an Ordinance is laid before the Chief   Pleas pursuant to subsection (2), the Chief Pleas may either- (a)  confirm  the  Ordinance,  whereupon  the  veto shall  cease  to  be  operative  and  the  Ordinance  shall  take effect  from  the  date  of  its  registration,  or  otherwise  in accordance with its provisions, as if it had not been vetoed; or (b)  it shall not be registered and shall not take effect\". refuse to confirm the Ordinance, whereupon 38. The  Seigneur  has  other  powers  and  responsibilities  under  the  Reform  Law.  The most  significant  for  the  purposes  of  this  appeal  are  these:  (1)  the  Seigneur  appoints  the Seneschal (with the approval of the Lieutenant Governor): section 6(1); (2) the Seigneur’s consent  is  needed  for  the  Seneschal  to  summon  an  extraordinary  meeting  of  the  Chief  Page 10 \\x0c           Pleas:  section  32(2)(b);  (3)  the  Seigneur  is  a  Trustee  (section  56),  making  him responsible, together with the other three Trustees (the Seneschal, Prévôt and Greffier) for all Island Properties, i.e. schools, teachers’ houses, the medical centre, and administrative offices. The Seneschal 39. The Seneschal continues to be appointed by the Seigneur with the approval of the Lieutenant Governor: section 6(1). He is no longer appointed for a limited 3-year  term: his appointment is for life. The reason is that it was thought that a Seneschal with a three-year term might not give a fair trial in litigation involving the Crown or the Seigneur if he were seeking re-appointment. By section 6(2), the Seneschal may only be removed by the direction of the Lieutenant Governor “for good cause” (formerly, he was simply subject to removal “by the direction of the Crown”: section 22(1) of the 1951 Law). The  Seneschal  is an unelected  member of the Chief  Pleas: section 21(1)(b).  The 40. Seneschal continues to be the ex officio President of the Chief Pleas: section 35(1). He is a Trustee of Island property (section 56). 41.  Meetings of the Chief Pleas are convened by the Seneschal by the publication of an  Agenda  (section  32(1)).  He  has  power  (if  the  Seigneur  consents)  to  summon  an extraordinary  meeting  of  the  Chief  Pleas,  and  a  discretion  to  determine  whether  an extraordinary  meeting  will  be  held  at  the  request  of  at  least  nine  Conseillers  (section 32(2)(b) and (c)). The Seneschal has no right “to speak or to vote at any meeting of the Chief  Pleas”  (section  35(4)).  It  was  common  ground  that  he  may  speak  insofar  as  is necessary to enable him to preside over the Chief Pleas. But he cannot speak in favour of or against the substance of any matter raised by the Conseillers.  Seneschal’s procedural powers 42. The  Chief  Pleas  has  power  to  make  rules  of  procedure  (section  36(1))  but  the Rules of Procedure under the 1951 Law have been applied by the Chief Pleas under the Reform Law. New rules were adopted in April 2009. 43. The procedural powers of the Seneschal under the rules which were current when the  decisions  of  the  Committee  for  the  Affairs  of  Jersey  and  Guernsey  and  the  Privy Council were taken are these. He convenes meetings by means of  an  agenda: rule  1(2). He may, on grounds of public interest, decline to allow a question to be put or rule that the  question  need  not  be  answered:  rule  8.  He  is  responsible  for  maintaining  order  at  a  Page 11 \\x0c          meeting and, subject to the provisions of the Rules, regulates the conduct of business: rule 10(1). He may direct a member to discontinue his speech if he considers it irrelevant or tedious repetition of the member\\'s arguments: rule 10(4). Where he considers that grave disorder  has  arisen  in  a  meeting  he  may  adjourn  the  meeting:  rule  10(7).  He  decides whether  to  allow  an  amendment  to  be  moved  in  the  case  of  non  compliance  with  the requisite  notice  period  (rule  11(2)).  He  decides  whether  or  not  a  member\\'s  oral contribution  to  the  debate  is  relevant  and  therefore  permissible  (rule  11(6)),  and  he decides the order of proposed amendments (rule 11(8)).  He provides clarification on the Rules: rule 13. The proceedings: jurisdiction  44. By claim form dated April 4, 2008, the appellants sought judicial review of (1) the decision dated March 19, 2008 of the Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey to recommend that Royal Assent be granted to the Reform Law; and (2) the decision of the  Privy  Council  to  advise  Her  Majesty,  on  April  9,  2008,  to  grant  Royal  Assent  in accordance with the first decision, which resulted in an Order in Council of that date. 45. There is no issue on this appeal about jurisdiction to determine the legality of the decisions  of  the  Committee  and  the  Privy  Council.  Wyn  Williams  J  held  in  the Administrative Court [2008] 3 WLR 867, paras 98-102, and the respondents accepted in the Court of Appeal [2009] 2 WLR 1205 (see Pill LJ at paras 19-21) that to the extent that the  Reform  Law  is  in  breach  of  Convention  rights,  then  the  appellants  are  entitled  to appropriate relief in these proceedings. That is because the respondents expressly advised Her Majesty the Queen to approve the Reform Law on the ground that it did not involve any  breach  of  the  obligations  of  the  United  Kingdom  under  the  Convention.  It  will, however, be necessary to revert to the question of jurisdiction because of the appellants’ contention that the courts of this country also have jurisdiction to grant relief on the basis that the respondents were acting as public authorities for the purposes of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 when recommending the Order in Council by which the Reform Law was given Royal Assent. The judgments below 46.  Wyn  Williams  J  decided  that  the  comparatively  limited  rights  and  powers conferred  upon  the  Seigneur  and  the  Seneschal  did  not  impair  the  essence  of  the  rights conferred  under  Article  3  of  the  First  Protocol.  Neither  was  entitled  to  vote.  The Seigneur’s  right  of  veto  was  limited  to  Ordinances  and  was  no  more  than  a  means  by which he could ask Chief Pleas to revisit a decision. It was impossible to envisage that the power could ever be used in such a way that it would frustrate the will of the Conseillers permanently. There was no principle that a State could not comply with Article 3 unless  Page 12 \\x0c        every  member  of  its  legislative  body  were  democratically  elected.  The  positions  of Seigneur  and  Seneschal  had  been  inextricably  linked  with  the  governance  of  Sark  over centuries, and there was no legal impediment to there being some continuation of those links. Their membership was being pursued for a legitimate aim, namely to form part of a package of measures which was most likely or at least very likely to find favour with a majority of the members of Chief Pleas as currently constituted, and to provide some link between the past and the future. The Reform Law was not in breach of Article 3 in not permitting aliens to stand for election.   47.  Wyn  Williams  J  also  decided  that  the  combination  of  the  judicial  and  other functions  of  the  Seneschal  was  consistent  with  the  duty  under  Article  6(1)  of  the Convention to establish an independent and impartial tribunal. His decision on that point was reversed by the Court of Appeal, and there was no further appeal on that point.  48. The  Court  of  Appeal  agreed  with  Wyn  Williams  J  so  far  as  the  position  of  the Seigneur  was  concerned,  and  by  a  majority  (Etherton  LJ  dissenting)  with  regard  to  the Seneschal. The principal points made by Pill and  Jacob LJJ  were these: all members of the Chief Pleas entitled to vote were elected in accordance with a procedure about which there was no complaint. The power of the Seigneur to speak (but not vote) in Chief Pleas made  sense  in  a  small  community  such  as  Sark,  and  would  not  undermine  the  free expression of the people. The power of the Seigneur to veto Ordinances temporarily, and the  requirement  for  the  Seneschal’s  consent  to  an  extraordinary  meeting  of  Chief  Pleas requested in writing by nine Conseillers, might serve the democratic will in providing the opportunity at a later date for a more representative meeting, if some members of Chief Pleas were away from Sark. There was no reason to believe that the Seneschal would use his position as ex officio President to thwart the will of elected members. If his procedural powers  were  not  acceptable  to  the  elected  members,  Chief  Pleas  could  alter  the  rules. Jacob  LJ  added  that  if  the  elected  members  of  Chief  Pleas  were  to  decide  that  the continued  presence  and  powers  of  the  Seigneur  and  Seneschal  in  Chief  Pleas  were obstructive to the expression or exercise of the will of the people, there would be nothing that could be done legally to prevent Chief Pleas from voting for a change. The Reform Law did not breach Article 3 in failing to grant to aliens the right to stand for election to Chief  Pleas  and,  in  the  absence  of  such  a  breach,  Article  14  of  the  Convention  did  not apply. Etherton LJ dissented with respect to the role and functions of the Seneschal. His 49. view  was  that  an  unelected  President  for  life  of  a  unicameral  legislature,  who  was  not appointed  to  office  by  the  electorate  or  by  the  elected  members  of  the  legislature,  and whom  the  elected  members  had  no  power  to  discipline  or  remove  as  President,  was  in principle  fundamentally  inconsistent  with  a  political  democracy.  His  procedural  powers and  the  requirement  of  his  consent  for  extraordinary  meetings  taken  as  a  whole  were capable of enabling suppression of free and appropriate debate within the Chief Pleas by elected  members  on  topics  they  or  some  of  them  wished  to  raise.  There  was  no  clearly practicable  means  for  the  elected  members  of  the  Chief  Pleas  to  control  abusive  or otherwise  incorrect  exercise  by  the  Seneschal  of  his  powers  as  President.  They  had  no  Page 13 \\x0c          power to dismiss or suspend him. They could apply in writing to the Lieutenant Governor under  section  6(2)  of  the  Reform  Law  for  his  removal  as  Seneschal,  but  that  process would be neither swift nor certain. The particular features of the Sark constitution under the Reform Law and the social and constitutional standing of the Seneschal in Sark were obvious  disincentives  for  elected  members  to  challenge  the  rulings  and  conduct  of  the Seneschal as President. In addition to serving as President of the Chief Pleas he held the following positions under the Reform Law: one of the four trustees who, subject to any direction  of  the  Chief  Pleas,  manage,  control  and  dispose  of  its  property  and  who  sign contracts on its behalf; the returning officer for the purposes of elections of Conseillers to the  Chief  Pleas  and,  as  such,  is  required  to  do  everything  necessary  for  effectually conducting the election; critically, under the Reform Law the only court on Sark was the Court of the Seneschal in which, unless a Deputy Seneschal or a Lieutenant Seneschal is appointed  to  sit,  the  Seneschal  sat  alone. The  elected  members  would  doubtless  bear  in mind  the  possibility  that  at  some  point  in  the future  they  might  have  to  appear  in  court before him or one of his deputies or lieutenants in civil or criminal proceedings. The issues on appeal The principal issues on this appeal are (1) whether (as the appellants contend) the 50. position of the Seneschal and the Seigneur in the Chief Pleas of Sark, as provided for in the  Reform  Law,  constitutes  a  breach  of  the  right  conferred  by  Article  3  of  the  First Protocol to participate in elections which ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people  in  the  choice  of  the  legislature;  and  (2)  whether  (as  the  appellants  contend)  the prohibition imposed by the Reform Law on persons who are “aliens” from standing for election  to  the  Chief  Pleas  of  Sark  is  a  breach  of  the  right  under  Article  3  of  the  First Protocol, read alone and/or in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention.  Although there is no cross-appeal by the respondents on the issue of jurisdiction, 51. the appellants invited the House of Lords to determine whether, had it not been accepted by  the  respondents  that  the  decisions  of  the  Committee  for  the  Affairs  of  Jersey  and Guernsey  and  the  Privy  Council  were  amenable  to  judicial  review  (because  the respondents  expressly  advised  Her  Majesty  to  approve  the  Reform  Law  on  the  ground that it did not involve any breach of the international obligations of the United Kingdom under the Convention), the Human Rights Act 1998 applies to the decisions.  Article 3 of the First Protocol 52. There have been more than 50 decisions of the European Court of Human Rights on Article 3 of the First Protocol. The following principles emerge from these decisions, particularly from the relatively early case of Mathieu-Mohin v Belgium (1988) 10 EHRR 1, and the recent decision of the Grand Chamber in Yumak v Turkey (2009) 48 EHRR 61.  Page 14 \\x0c           First,  Article  3  of  the  First  Protocol  enshrines  a  characteristic  principle  of  an 53. effective  democracy.  It  is  of  prime  importance  in  the  Convention  system,  of  which democracy constitutes a fundamental element, and the rights guaranteed under Article 3 of  the  First  Protocol  are  crucial  to  establishing  and  maintaining  the  foundations  of  an effective  and  meaningful  democracy  governed  by  the  rule  of  law:  Mathieu-Mohin  v Belgium, at para 47; Yumak v Turkey, at paras 105 and 107. See also Zdanoka v Latvia (2007) 45 EHRR 478, para 98 (Grand Chamber); Tanase v Moldova [2008] ECHR 1468, at paras 100-101. Second, although Article 3 is phrased in terms of the obligation of the Contracting 54. States  to  hold  elections  which  ensure  the  free  expression  of  the  opinion  of  the  people rather than in terms of individual rights, Article 3 guarantees individual rights, including the  right  to  vote  and  the  right  to  stand  for  election:  Mathieu-Mohin v  Belgium,  at  paras 48-51; Yumak v Turkey, at para 109(i); Zdanoka v Latvia, at para 102. Third, there is room for “implied limitations” on the rights enshrined in Article 3, 55. and  Contracting  States  must  be  given  a  wide  margin  of  appreciation  in  this  sphere: Mathieu-Mohin v Belgium, at para 52; Yumak v Turkey, at para 109(ii).  56. Fourth, the content of the obligation under Article 3 varies in accordance with the historical  and  political  factors  specific  to  each  State;  and  for  the  purposes  of  applying Article 3, any electoral legislation must be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, so that features which would be unacceptable in the context of one  system  may  be  justified  in  the  context  of  another,  at  least  so  long  as  the  chosen system provides for conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people  in  the  choice  of  the  legislature:  Yumak  v  Turkey  at  para  109(iii);  Aziz  v  Cyprus (2005) 41 EHRR 164, para 28. 57. Fifth,  Article  3  is  not  (by  contrast  with  some  other  Convention  rights,  such  as those  enumerated  in  Articles  8  to  11)  subject  to  a  specific  list  of  legitimate  limitations, and the Contracting States are therefore free to rely in general in justifying a limitation on aims  which  are  proved  to  be  compatible  with  the  principle  of  the  rule  of  law  and  the general  objectives  of  the  Convention:  Yumak  v  Turkey,  at  para  109(iii);  Tanase  v Moldova, at para 105. Sixth, limitations on the exercise of the right to vote or stand for election must be 58. imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim, must not be arbitrary or disproportionate, and must not  interfere  with  the  free  expression  of  the  opinion  of  the  people  in  the  choice  of  the legislature: Yumak v Turkey, at para 109(iii)-(iv).   Page 15 \\x0c        Seventh,  such  limitations  must  not  curtail  the  rights  under  Article  3  to  such  an 59. extent as to impair their very essence, and deprive them of their effectiveness. They must reflect, or not run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage. Any departure from the principle of universal suffrage risks undermining the democratic validity of the legislature and the laws which it promulgates: Mathieu-Mohin v Belgium, at para 52; Yumak v Turkey, at para 109(iv). 60. Eighth, as regards the right to stand for election, “…the Court accepts that stricter requirements  may  be  imposed  on  the  eligibility  to  stand  for  election  to  parliament,  as distinguished  from  voting  eligibility…”: Melnychenko  v  Ukraine  (2006)  42  EHRR  784, para 57. In Zdanoka v. Latvia (2007) 45 EHRR 478, para 106 the Grand Chamber said: “The  Convention  institutions  have  had  fewer  occasions  to deal  with  an  alleged  violation  of  an  individual’s  right  to stand as a candidate for election, i.e, the so-called ‘passive’ aspect of the rights under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. In this regard the Court has emphasised that the Contracting States enjoy  considerable  latitude  in  establishing  constitutional rules  on  the  status  of  members  of  parliament,  including criteria governing eligibility to stand for election. Although they  have  a  common  origin  in the  need  to  ensure  both  the independence of elected representatives and the freedom of choice of electors, these criteria vary in accordance with the historical  and  political  factors  specific  to  each  State.  The multiplicity  of  situations  provided  for  in  the  constitutions and electoral legislation of numerous member States of the Council  of  Europe  shows the  diversity  of  possible approaches  in  this  area.  Therefore,  for  the  purposes  of applying  Article  3,  any  electoral  legislation  must  be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned.” 61. Ninth,  the  Court  takes  account  of  the  practice  of  members  of  the  Council  of Europe in assessing the compatibility of electoral rules with Article 3, in particular in the area of qualifications to stand for election. In Yumak v Turkey (at para 111) the Court said in relation to electoral systems that “… the large variety of situations provided for in the electoral  legislation  of  numerous  Member  States  of  the  Council  of  Europe  shows  the diversity of the possible options.” In Melnychenko v Ukraine, at para 30, the Court, when considering whether it was compatible with Article 3 to impose a residence requirement before citizens could stand for election, referred to the fact that 19 States did not impose any such requirement for participation in elections while 21 States did so for elections to one or more of the legislative chambers. In Gitonas v Greece (1997) 26 EHRR 691 the Court decided that the disqualification in Greece of civil servants from elected office was compatible  with  Article  3,  and  at  para  40  it  said  that  “equivalent  provisions  exist  in  Page 16 \\x0c          several  member  States  of  the  Council  of  Europe.”  In  Sukhovetsky  v  Ukraine  (2007)  44 EHRR  57,  at  para  76,  the  Court,  in  deciding  that  the  Ukrainian  rules  with  regard  to electoral  deposits  were  compatible  with  Article  3,  considered  the  practice  of  the Convention  States  with  regard  to  the  amount  of  the  deposit  and  whether  it  was appropriate that it should be forfeit if the candidate failed to win election irrespective of the percentage of votes cast. 62. Examples of the operation of these principles as regards the right to vote include Yumak  v  Turkey,  which  concerned  a  Turkish  law  under  which  a  political  party  had  to receive at least 10% of the national vote in an election in order to obtain any seats in the Turkish  parliament,  and  which  was  the  highest  threshold  in  the  Contracting  States.  The effect was that two of the eighteen parties which had taken part in the 2002 elections had passed the 10% threshold and secured seats, with the result that 45% of the voting public were  not  represented  in  the  parliament.  It  was  held  that  the  threshold  law  served  the legitimate  aim  of  avoiding  excessive  and  destabilising  parliamentary  fragmentation  and thus  strengthening  governmental  stability.  Although  it  appeared  excessive,  it  was  not disproportionate in that it did not impair the essence of the rights secured by Article 3 of the First Protocol. But a blanket disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners regardless of the  nature  of  the  offence  or  length  of  sentence  was  held  to  be  disproportionate:  Hirst  v United Kingdom (No 2) (2006) 42 EHRR 41 (Grand Chamber).  63. As  regards  the  right  to  stand  for  election,  it  has  been  held  that  public  servants could be barred from standing for election: Ahmed v United Kingdom (2000) 29 EHRR 1; Gitonas v Greece, supra; and a former member of the Communist Party could be banned from standing for election in Latvia because she could be presumed to be anti-democratic: Zdanoka v Latvia (2007) 45 EHRR 478. But the requirement of a command of Latvian at the  highest  level  from  a  Russian  minority  candidate  for  election  was  disproportionate:  Podkolzina v Latvia [2002] ECHR 405. 64. The  effect  of  these  principles  is  that  there  is  no  narrow  focus  on  one  particular element of democracy. The electoral rules have to be looked at in the round, and in the light  of  historical  and  political  factors.  The  proper  application  of  these  principles  leads inevitably to the conclusion that the Reform Law is not in breach of Article 3 of the First Protocol.  65. The  appellants  submit  that  it  is  incompatible  with  the  most  basic  principles  of democracy as expressed in Article 3 of the First Protocol for unelected individuals to be members of the Chief Pleas with the power (1) in the case of the Seigneur, to speak in the Chief Pleas and to veto (even on a temporary basis) legislation and (2) in the case of the Seneschal, to preside and control proceedings in the Chief Pleas, in each case in addition to their other important functions and powers on Sark (Appellants’ Case, at para 58).  Page 17 \\x0c         The appellants exaggerate their case. The starting point is that only Conseillers are 66. entitled  to  vote  in  the  Chief  Pleas,  and  therefore  it  is  only  Conseillers  who  determine whether  legislation  is  to  be  enacted.  The  electorate  of  Sark  consists  of  fewer  than  500 voters,  who  choose  28  elected  Conseillers  by  a  process  of  casting  28  votes  each  and electing  the  28  candidates  with  the  largest  number  of  votes.  There  is  therefore  one Conseiller  for  every  17-18  persons  in  the  electorate.  It  is  not  easy  to  envisage,  in  the words  of  Article  3,  conditions  which  are  more  likely  to  ensure  the  expression  of  the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature. The appellants’ case was, in part, that to the extent that members of the legislature 67. (implicitly  including  both  chambers)  were  not  elected,  Article  3  was  not  satisfied: Appellants’  Case  at  para  63(2).  That  was  put  too  widely.  It  is  plain  that  the  effect  of Article  3  is  not  to  require  that  all  members  of  the  legislature  of  a  Contracting  State  be elected.  A  legislature  may  consist  of  two  chambers,  and  a  wholly  unelected  second chamber, such as the House of Lords, is not in itself incompatible with Article 3. When the  First  Protocol  was  under  negotiation,  the  formula  “The  High  Contracting  Parties undertake  to  hold  free  elections  of  the  Legislature”  was  proposed,  but  it  was  not acceptable  to  some  countries,  because  it  might  be  interpreted  as  an  obligation  to  hold elections for both chambers of the legislature. This was unacceptable to the Governments of some States where the upper chamber was in whole or in part not elected but hereditary (such as the United Kingdom) or appointed (as in Belgium). The Committee of Ministers recorded  that  the  original  text,  which  was  maintained,  “had  been  carefully  drafted  to avoid  this  difficulty”:  Collected  Edition  of  the  Travaux  Préparatoires  of  the  European Convention  on  Human  Rights,  Vol  VIII  (1985),  pp  48-52,  letter  dated  November  28, 1951, from Chairman of the Committee of Ministers to the President of the Consultative Assembly. It was for that  reason  and  by reference to those documents that  the Court in Mathieu-Mohin v Belgium said, at para 53, that “Article 3 applies only to the election of the ‘legislature’, or at least of one of its chambers if it has two or more.” The  European  Commission  for  Democracy  through  Law  (also  known  as  the 68. Venice Commission) was established in 1990 as the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters. The Venice Commission adopted guidelines on elections as part of a code of good practice in electoral matters. Guideline 5 was that “at least one chamber of the national parliament” must be elected by direct suffrage.  Consequently  the  appellants  also  formulated  the  principle  for  which  they 69. contended  as  being  that  “all  the  members  of  a  unicameral  legislature  must  be  elected”: Appellants’ Case at para 63(3). No doubt where, as here, there is a unicameral legislature, best practice is that it should be an elected assembly. Jacob LJ observed correctly in the Court  of  Appeal  that  “[i]f  one  were  starting  from  scratch,  there  can  be  few  who  would think  the  new  Reform  Law  of  Sark  satisfactory  …  [T]o  confer  by  heredity  upon  an unelected man the positions and powers of the Seigneur … would be going too far by the standards of modern democratic governance”: para 117.  Page 18 \\x0c         It  does  not  follow,  however,  that  as  a  matter  of  Convention  law  there  is  an 70. invariable  rule  that  all  members  must  be  elected  irrespective  of  their  powers  and irrespective of the circumstances. The effect of the jurisprudence under Article 3 is that all  the  circumstances  must  be  considered.  It  is  not  a  necessary  consequence,  therefore, that  the  mere  existence  of  some  unelected  members  contravenes  Article  3.  In  2007  the Barclay brothers themselves made a representation supporting an option for constitutional change  which  would  have  continued  the  reservation  of  half  of  the  seats  for  16  Tenants elected by the Tenants. “Membership” of two unelected individuals in the circumstances of this case does 71. not contravene Article 3. The purpose of Article 3 is to ensure that legislation is enacted through  genuinely  democratic  processes.  An  electorate  of  about  500  elects  28  voting representatives.  Neither  the  Seigneur  nor  the  Seneschal  can  vote.  It  is  true  that  the Seigneur can speak on matters of substance in debate. But the fact that unelected persons may influence the outcome of debate is not undemocratic, especially when the influence is open and transparent.  72. Even if Article 3 did in principle require that even non-voting members be elected, then a limitation on that principle by having two prominent non-voting members would be well within the margin of appreciation in the light of the constitutional history and the political factors relevant to Sark. The position of the Seigneur dates from 1565, and the position  of  the  Seneschal  from  1675.  Until  1922  the  composition  of  the  Chief  Pleas reflected  the  feudal  system  in  Sark.  Between  1922  and  2008,  the  feudal  Tenants dominated  the  Chief  Pleas.  Even  the  introduction  in  1922  of  a  minority  of  elected Deputies was not easily achieved. At the time this was a very controversial change. The Lieutenant  Governor  told  the  Chief  Pleas  members  that,  unless  they  agreed  to  changes approved by the Privy Council, the Island’s administration would be taken over forcibly: Sark Constitutional Review Committee, Report on the Future Constitution of the Island of Sark, January 2002, para 62. 73. The  Reform  Law  eventually  introduced  universal  suffrage  for  the  election  of  all those members who could vote on legislation. The fact that the Reform Law was enacted by, and therefore with the consent of, the legislature was relied on by the respondents. But that  would  not  save  it  from  incompatibility  with  the  Convention.  Some  profoundly undemocratic  laws  have  been  enacted  by  democratically  elected  legislatures.  In  any event, the Reform Law was enacted by the unreformed Chief Pleas which was certainly not  fully  democratic.  But  the  respondents  are  right  in  their  contention  that  the  Chief Pleas’  support  for  the  Reform  Law  is  a  political  factor  of  weight,  because  it  offers confidence that the Reform Law will command the level of respect and legitimacy in the eyes of the people of Sark that is necessary to secure significant constitutional change.  74. Thus even if the membership of the Seigneur and the Seneschal is to be regarded as a limitation on the people’s right to choose the legislature, then the limitation falls well  Page 19 \\x0c         within  the  margin  of  appreciation  allowed  by  Article  3.  It  fulfils  all  the  conditions suggested by the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court. It cannot be said to be arbitrary. Because  the  Seigneur  and  the  Seneschal  cannot  vote,  it  cannot  be  said  to  be  lacking  in proportionality. The free expression of the opinion of the people of Sark is not impeded by  it.  Nor  could  it  be  plausibly  suggested  that  their  membership  impairs  the  “very essence”  of  the  people’s  right  to  choose  the  legislature,  or  deprives  the  right  of  its effectiveness.  Nor  can  it  be  argued  seriously  that  the  Seigneur’s  right  to  speak  in  the Chief Pleas will frustrate the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.  75. Nor  is  the  conclusion  affected  by  the  other  powers  and  responsibilities  of  the Seigneur and the Seneschal. The Seigneur has the power temporarily to veto Ordinances (but not Laws) under section 38 of the Reform Law. The effect of section 38 is that where an Ordinance has been vetoed then it is laid before the Chief Pleas again not earlier than 10  days  later,  but  no  later  than  21  days  later,  whereupon  the  Chief  Pleas  will  either confirm, or refuse to confirm, the Ordinance. The appellants argue that the existence of this power will inevitably deter the Chief Pleas from adopting a position opposed by the Seigneur,  whether  because  the  Chief  Pleas  wishes  to  avoid  a  veto  or  simply  because  it prefers to seek the approval, or avoid the disapproval, of the Seigneur. 76. It  is  true  that  HM  Procureur,  the  head  of  the  Government  legal  service  in Guernsey,  in  a  letter  of  April  30,  2004  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Sark  Constitutional Steering Committee,  wrote: “I  regret  that  I  remain  opposed  to  the  retention  by  the Seigneur of any power of veto. ... In my opinion it is simply unacceptable  in  the  21st  century  for  an  unelected  and unappointed citizen, whatever his civic role, or whatever his rank  or  position  in  Sark  society,  to  be  able  to  veto legislation  passed  by  the  (soon  to  be  more  democratically constituted) Chief Pleas, irrespective of whether that veto is absolute  or  limited.  ...  The  Seigneur  has  informed  me  that he has no strong feelings on the Seigneurial veto. He writes: ‘If  it  is  a  possibility  that  it  might  cause  problems  in  the future then I am quite happy that it should be abolished’  The  present  Seigneur’s  evidence  was  that  he  had  never  used  his  power  of 77. temporary  veto,  and  that  he  had  no  recollection  of  his  predecessor  (his  grandmother, Dame  Sybil  Hathaway)  having  used  it.  His  evidence  was  that  he  would  only  consider using it in, at most, two circumstances: (a) if an Ordinance had not been drafted by the Guernsey Law Officers and he considered that it might be ultra vires; or (b) in what he describes as the unlikely event that an ordinance were passed by a close vote at a meeting  Page 20 \\x0c         of the Chief Pleas at which only a minimal number of members were present and he were to feel that, with a normal turnout, the Ordinance might possibly have been rejected.  78. The suggestion by the appellants that the power might have a chilling effect on the exercise  of  the  power  of  the  democratically  elected  members  to  legislate  is  wholly speculative. It is legitimate to take account of the fact that the power has not been used in modern times, and that the Seigneur has indicated that it will be used in only very limited circumstances. The use of the power if few members are present and voting will tend to ensure  that  the  democratic  will  is  respected  by  ensuring  that  sufficient  numbers  of members are present. That objective could have been achieved by different means (such as  a  special  quorum  for  the  passage  of  legislation),  but  the  method  proposed  is proportionate and consistent with Article 3.  79. The unelected House of Lords has power (subject to the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949) to delay United Kingdom legislation, and that is a power which directly affects the process  of  the  elected  chamber.  The  appellants  do  not  suggest  that  that  power  is inconsistent with Article 3. The reason why the power is compatible with Article 3 is that it  has  its  origin  in  historical  and  political  factors,  it  is  not  arbitrary  or  disproportionate, and it does not affect the essence of democratic rights. Indeed in R (Jackson) v Attorney General  [2005]  UKHL  56,  [2006]  1  AC  262,  para  32,  Lord  Bingham  of  Cornhill suggested  that  the  use  of  the  Parliament  Acts  to  secure  extension  of  the  maximum duration of Parliament by overriding the need for the passage of legislation through the House of Lords might itself be contrary to Article 3. So also in theory Her Majesty could refuse Royal Assent, although by convention it cannot be refused except on the advice of ministers, and the power to refuse it has not been exercised since 1708: see Bradley and Ewing, Constitutional and Administrative Law, 14th ed 2007, p 21. The  appellants  argue  that  the  delaying  power  of  the  House  of  Lords  is  not 80. incompatible with Article 3 because the requirements of Article 3 are satisfied if there is one wholly elected legislative chamber. This is unpersuasive. It does not follow from the fact that Article 3 does not regulate the composition of a second chamber that there are no limitations  imposed  by  Article  3  on  the  powers  of  the  second  chamber.  If  a  second chamber  had  a  power  permanently  to  frustrate  the  will  of  the  democratically  elected chamber, and the power was not purely theoretical, like Her Majesty’s power to withhold Royal Assent, then there would at the least be a case for breach of Article 3.  Nor  are  the  appellants  assisted  by  the  existence  of  the  Seigneur’s  other  powers. 81. Apart  from  the  power  of  temporary  veto  of  Ordinances  already  discussed,  the  only  one which affects proceedings of the Chief Pleas is that the Seigneur’s consent is needed for the  Seneschal  to  summon  an  extraordinary  meeting  of  the  Chief  Pleas:  Reform  Law, section 32(2)(b). The Chief Pleas has to meet four times annually: section 32(2). All three methods of summoning extraordinary meetings require the action of an unelected official: (1) at the direction of the Lieutenant Governor; (2) by the Seneschal with the consent of  Page 21 \\x0c         the Seigneur; and (3) with the consent of the Seneschal on the written request of at least nine Conseillers. The mere existence of this power does not undermine effective political democracy. If there were any serious prospect of its being abused, the Chief Pleas could amend the Reform Law.  The  Seigneur’s  other  powers  do  not  affect  the  democratic  process.  They  simply 82. underline  his  status  on  Sark.  He  appoints  the  Seneschal  (with  the  approval  of  the Lieutenant Governor) and the Deputy Seneschal (in consultation with the Seneschal and with the approval of the Lieutenant Governor), and he appoints the Deputy Seigneur. He appoints the Prévôt and the Greffier subject to the approval of the Lieutenant Governor. His consent is required for Guernsey police officers to attend in Sark, and his consent is required  for  removal  of  a  special  constable.  The  Seigneur  is  a  Trustee,  making  him responsible, together with the other three Trustees (the Seneschal, Prévôt and Greffier) for all Island Properties. It is not suggested that the existence of these powers is contrary to Article 3.  83. So far as the position of the Seneschal is concerned, it is true that it is anomalous that the presiding officer of an elected assembly should be an unelected official appointed by another unelected (and indeed hereditary) official. Etherton LJ was right to say that it is  relevant  that  the  members  of  Chief  Pleas  have  no  power  to  dismiss  or  suspend  the Seneschal, and that the process of applying in writing to the Lieutenant Governor under section  6(2)  of  the  Reform  Law  for  his  removal  as  Seneschal  would  not  be  swift  or certain. But it does not follow that legislation which provides for an unelected presiding officer is contrary to the duty to allow free elections for the choice of the legislature under Article 3 of the First Protocol. In any event, for essentially the same reasons as apply in the  case  of  the  Seigneur,  the  position  of  the  Seneschal  is  well  within  the  margin  of appreciation,  taking  into  account  historical  and  political  factors,  and  cannot  realistically be  said  to  impair  the  essence  of  the  rights  under  Article  3  nor  to  deprive  them  of effectiveness.  84. It is not suggested that the procedural powers themselves are contrary to Article 3. What is said is that the width of the procedural powers makes it inappropriate that they should  be  exercised  by  an  unelected  person.  But  they  are  powers  which  any  presiding officer would be given or would need. It is true that they are capable of being misused, but  they  could  equally be  misused  by  an  elected  officer.  If  there  were  any  abuse  of  the powers, the Chief Pleas could alter the procedural rules under section 36(1) of the Reform Law without the need for any consent.  85. There is nothing in the appellants’ reliance on the other powers of the Seneschal. He  is  ex  officio  the  returning  officer  for  elections  held  under  the  Reform  Law.  He  is  a Trustee  of  Island  property.  In  both  capacities  he  must  act  according  to  law,  and  in  the latter capacity on behalf and subject to the direction of the Chief Pleas: section 57.  Page 22 \\x0c         The right to stand for election The  appellants  do  not  suggest  that  Article  3  of  the  First  Protocol  itself  gives 86. resident aliens a right to stand for election. The primary way it is put in relation to Article 3 is that the prohibition on aliens from standing for election to the Chief Pleas advances no legitimate aim and is disproportionate, and therefore contrary to Article 3 of the First Protocol, given that (1) resident aliens may vote for elections to the Chief Pleas; and (2) the Law does not identify as eligible to stand those with sufficiently continuous or close links to, or a stake in Sark. Commonwealth citizens, British protected persons and citizens of the Republic of Ireland may stand for election to the Chief Pleas, so long as they are resident  in  Sark  or  own  property  there,  even  if  they  do  not  live  there.  The  appellants’ alternative case is that if citizens have the right to vote, then the prohibition on aliens (or, perhaps,  resident  aliens)  standing  for  election  to  the  Chief  Pleas  is  unjustifiable discrimination  on  grounds  of  nationality  contrary  to  Article  3  of  the  First  Protocol  read with Article 14 of the Convention.   87. The principal answer to the appellants’ case is that there are many decisions of the Strasbourg  Court  which  proceed  on  the  basis  that  the  rights  under  Article  3  belong  to citizens, and therefore not to aliens. In a passage in Mathieu-Mohin at (1988) 10 EHRRI, para 54 repeated or referred to in many subsequent judgments, the Court referred to the principle of equality of treatment of all citizens in the exercise of their right to vote and their  right  to  stand  for  election.  For  example,  in  Kovach  v  Ukraine  [2008]  ECHR  125, para 49, the Court said in the same context: “In this field, Contracting States enjoy a wide margin  of  appreciation,  provided  that  they  ensure  the  equality  of  treatment  for  all citizens.” In  Makuc  v  Slovenia  [2007]  ECHR  523,  para  206,  the  Court  said  “The  Court recalls that this provision guarantees individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election. However, these rights are not absolute but rather subject to limitations, such as citizenship …” citing Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2) (2006) 42 EHRR 41.  88. The  Guidelines  on  Elections  of  the  Venice  Commission  (referred  to  above,  para 68)  said,  in  the  context  of  conditions  for  voting  and  standing  for  election,  that  a nationality  requirement  may  apply,  but  that  it  would  be  advisable  for  foreigners  to  be allowed to vote in local elections after a certain period of residence: Guideline 1.1.b. The Explanatory  Report  said  (para  6.b-c)  that  most  countries’  legislation  laid  down  a nationality  requirement,  but  that  the  right  to  vote  and/or  the  right  to  stand  for  election might be subject to residence requirements. 89. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) is consistent with this  interpretation  of  the  European  Convention.  Article  25  grants  every  citizen,  without any of the distinctions in Article 2 (race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion,  national  or  social  origin,  property,  birth  or  other  status)  and  without unreasonable  restrictions  “the  right  and  the  opportunity  …  to  vote  and  to  be  elected  at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage …”.   Page 23 \\x0c        In Melnychenko v Ukraine (2006) 42 EHRR 784 the Court considered whether a 90. residence requirement could be imposed before a refugee from the Ukraine living in the United States could stand for election to the Parliament. As mentioned above (para 61), the Court looked at the practice of some 40 Council of Europe States, all of which had a nationality requirement together with (in about half of the States) a residence requirement for  participation  in  elections  by  expatriate  citizens  as  regards  at  least  one  chamber.  It treated  the  International  Covenant  as  expressing  the  relevant  international  law  on  the subject. The Court accepted that a residence requirement was compatible with Article 3, but concluded that the electoral commission’s decision that the applicant was not resident was unlawful.  91. On the hearing of this appeal the parties did not provide any comparative material on the practice of the Contracting States, but the website of the Inter-Parliamentary Union has a table of the conditions for voting and for standing for election, which confirms what was said in Melnychenko v Ukraine. There does not appear to be a single member of the Council  of  Europe  which  does  not  impose  a  citizenship  requirement  (in  some  cases coupled with a residence requirement). Py v France (2005) 42 EHRR 548 does not justify the appellants’ argument that 92. the  Court  has  implicitly  recognised  that  a  person  who  was  not  a  citizen  was  within  the scope of Article 3 of the First Protocol. New Caledonia was a French overseas territory, and as part of its move towards self-determination the French Constitution was amended to provide for a referendum on self-determination in the territory. A French law provided that  persons  resident  in  New  Caledonia  since  1988  would  have  the  right  to  vote  in  the referendum.  There  was  an  identical  qualification  for  obtaining  citizenship.  A  French national was appointed to a university post in New Caledonia in 1995, and claimed the right to vote in the referendum although he had not been resident there since 1988. It was held that the residence requirement pursued a legitimate aim and that although a ten year requirement might have seemed disproportionate, “local requirements” (Article 63, now Article  56)  justified  the  restrictions.  There  was  therefore  no  breach  of  Article  3  of  the First Protocol (or of Article 14 of the Convention). This is not a decision that non-citizens have  a  right  to  vote  or  stand  for  election.  It  was  simply  a  decision  that  the  length  of residence required by the French law as a qualification for voting in the referendum was justified by local requirements. In view of New Caledonia’s transitional status the right to vote  was  given  to  the  “population”  defined  by  reference  to  10  years’  residence,  which was  identical  to  the  citizenship  requirement. The  Court  specifically  referred  (at  [46])  to the  need  to  ensure  “citizen  participation  and  knowledge”  in  framing  rules  on  voting eligibility. 93. Consequently both in international law, as reflected in the International Covenant and  in  the  practice  of  States,  and  under  the  European  Convention,  as  reflected  in  the decisions  of  the  Strasbourg  Court  and  in  the  practice  of  the  members  of  the  Council  of Europe, it is citizens, and not non-resident aliens, who have the right to vote and stand for election. There may be some exceptional cases, for example where citizenship is withheld on,  for  example,  linguistic  grounds  from  communities  who  have  been  settled  on  the  Page 24 \\x0c           territory of a State for several generations: see Venice Commission Explanatory Report, para 1.16b. But the general rule is clear. 94. Sark  is  not  an  entity  in  international  law  and  has  no  separate  citizenship.  It  is entitled to restrict the right to stand for election to persons who are entitled to vote (which requires 12 months residence or registration in the rating register as the possessor of land) and who are not aliens within the meaning of United Kingdom law, where an “alien” is a person  who  is  neither  a  Commonwealth  citizen  nor  a  British  protected  person  nor  a citizen of the Republic of Ireland: British Nationality Act 1981, section 50(1).  95. Article  3  does  not  require  a  justification  for  qualifications  which  are  stricter  for standing  for  election  than  for  voting.  As  already  indicated,  it  is  well  established  that stricter requirements may be imposed on the eligibility to stand for election to parliament, as  distinguished  from  voting  eligibility:  Melnychenko  v  Ukraine  (2006)  42  EHRR  39, para 57; Zdanoka v. Latvia (2007) 45 EHRR 478, para 106 (Grand Chamber). Historical and  political  factors  have  determined  the  definition  of  “alien”  in  United  Kingdom  law. The  concept  of  Commonwealth  citizenship  is  of  course  very  wide,  but  eligibility  is limited  to  those  with  a  genuine  connection  with  Sark  in  the  form  of  residence  or ownership of property. It is clear that in the light of those factors and the breadth of the margin  of  appreciation,  the  exclusion  of  aliens  from  eligibility  to  stand  for  election  is justifiable. Articles 14 and 16 of the Convention 96. Nor does Article 14 assist the appellants. Article 14 provides that the “enjoyment of  the  rights  and  freedoms  set  forth  in  [the]  Convention  shall  be  secured  without discrimination  on  any  ground  …”  The  crucial  element  under  Article  14  is  that  the discrimination  must  be  in  “the  enjoyment  of  the  rights”  under  the  Convention.  The applicant  must  have  a  Convention  right  before  he  can  complain  of  discrimination: Moustaquim v. Belgium (1991) 13 EHRR 802, and contrast Gaygusuz v. Austria (1996) 23 EHRR 364.  As the Court said in, for example, Aziz v Cyprus (2005) 41 EHRR 164, paras 35-97. 36:  “The  Court  further  observes  that  Article  14  has  no independent  existence,  but  plays  an  important  role  by complementing the other provisions of the Convention and the Protocols, since it protects individuals, placed in similar  Page 25 \\x0c         situations, from any discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights  set  forth  in  those  other  provisions.  Where  a substantive  Article  of  the  Convention  has  been  invoked, both on its own and together with Article 14, and a separate breach  has  been  found  of  the  substantive  Article,  it  is  not generally necessary for the Court to consider the case under Article  14  also,  though  the  position  is  otherwise  if  a  clear inequality  of  treatment  in  the  enjoyment  of  the  right  in question is a fundamental aspect of the case.” 98. Consequently,  where  there  is  a  breach  of  Article  3,  it  has  not  normally  been necessary to deal with Article 14: e.g. Matthews v United Kingdom (1999) 28 EHRR 361, para 68; Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2) (2006) 42 EHRR 41, para 87; Tanase v Moldova [2008] ECHR 1468, para 116. Podkolzina v Latvia [2002] ECHR 405, para 42; Sadak v Turkey  (No  2)  (2003)  36  EHRR  23,  para  47;  Melnychenko  v  Ukraine  (2006)  42  EHRR 784,  para  71.  So  also  where  the  claim  under  Article  3  is  dismissed  and  the  complaint under Article 14 is essentially the same, it will not be necessary to consider Article 14: Mathieu-Mohin (1988) 10 EHRRI, para 59; Sukhovetskyy v Ukraine (2007) 44 EHRR 57, para 76. Aziz v Cyprus (2005) 41 EHRR 164 is an example of a case where there was a separate  breach  of  Article  14,  because  the  applicant  was  excluded  from  the  electoral register  because  he  was  a  member  of  the  Turkish  Cypriot  community.  The  complaint under Article 14 was not a mere restatement of the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the First Protocol. The applicant was a Cypriot national, resident in the Government-controlled area of Cyprus. The difference in treatment in that case resulted from the very fact  that  the  applicant  was  a  Turkish  Cypriot.  The  present  case  is  not  a  case  of discrimination in this sense. 99. There  was  some  discussion  in  argument  of  the  relevance  of  Article  16  of  the Convention to the present appeal. It provides that “nothing in Articles 10, 11 and 14 shall be regarded as preventing the High Contracting Parties from imposing restrictions on the political activity of aliens.” Article 16 is of very limited scope. It applies only to Articles 10,  11  and  14,  and  has  been  held  not  to  apply  to  non-nationals  who  are  citizens  of  EU countries:  Piermont v France (1995) 20 EHRR 301. Because aliens do not have a right under  Article  3  of  the  First  Protocol  to  stand  for  election,  there  is  no  scope  for  the operation of Article 16. The applicability of the Human Rights Act 1998 100.  The  respondents  accept  that  to  the  extent  that  the  Reform  Law  breaches Convention rights, then the appellants are entitled to relief in these proceedings. That is because  the  respondents  expressly  advised  Her  Majesty  to  approve  the  Reform  Law  on the ground that  it  did not involve any breach of  the  obligations  of  the  United  Kingdom under  the  Convention:  R  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department,  Ex  p  Launder  Page 26 \\x0c          [1997] 1 WLR 839, 867, per Lord Hope of Craighead. Consequently the decision of the Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey and the Order in Council are subject to judicial review: R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No.  2)  [2009]  1  AC  453,  para  35  (Lord  Hoffmann)  and  para  105  (Lord  Rodger  of Earlsferry). 101.  The  Human  Rights  Act  1998  contains  no  provision  as  to  its  territorial  scope, except  that  section  22(6)  provides  that  it  extends  to  Northern  Ireland.  As  already mentioned,  amendments  to  extend  the  Act  to  the  Channel  Islands  and  the  Isle  of  Man were rejected or withdrawn during the passage of the Act. 102.  The appellants contend that the courts of this country also have the power and the duty to grant relief on the basis that the respondents were acting as public authorities for the purposes of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 when recommending the Order in Council by which the Reform Law was given Royal Assent. The respondents’ position is that the Act does not apply because (a) it was not intended to apply to obligations of the United Kingdom assumed under Article 56 (formerly Article 63) of the Convention, and Article 4 of the First Protocol, in respect of compliance with the Convention in territories for  the  international  relations  of  which  it  is  responsible;  and  (b)  in  any  event  the respondents were not acting as public authorities of the United Kingdom for the purposes of  section  6  of  the  Act,  but  were  acting  to  advise  Her  Majesty  in  respect  of  her  role  as sovereign of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. Wyn Williams J accepted both points: [2008] 3 WLR  867,  paras  89-96.  The  Court  of  Appeal  agreed  with  Wyn  Williams  J  on  the  first point, but disagreed on the second point: Pill LJ: [2009] 2 WLR 1205, paras 106-109.  103.  The  appellants  accepted  in  the  hearing  before  the  Appellate  Committee  that  the point was academic, but drew attention to the fact that the House of Lords was prepared to address such points if they were of general importance: R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Salem [1999] 1 AC 450, 456-457.  104. In  R  (Quark  Fishing  Ltd)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  Foreign  and  Commonwealth Affairs [2006] 1 AC 529 the Secretary of State had instructed the Commissioner of South Georgia  to  issue  fishing  licences  to  two  specified  vessels,  which  had  the  effect  that  the claimant’s  vessel  did  not  receive  a  licence.  The  claimant  sought  judicial  review  and damages  for  deprivation  of  a  possession  under  Article  1  of  the  First  Protocol.  The Convention had been extended to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, but not the First Protocol. The instruction was quashed on the ground of procedural unfairness: [2002] EWCA Civ 1409. 105.  The question before the House of Lords was whether the claimant could sue for damages under sections 6 and 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998. As in the present appeal,  Page 27 \\x0c        this was taken to involve two issues, failure on either of which was fatal to the claim. The first issue was whether the instruction had been issued by the Crown in right of the United Kingdom, or in right of South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands. In the latter event the Secretary  of  State  acting  on  behalf  of  HM  the  Queen  would  not  be  a  United  Kingdom public authority for the purposes of section 6. The second issue was whether the claimant had established breach of a Convention right for the purposes of section 7 of the Human Rights Act. 106.  On the first issue it was held by a majority that the instruction had been given by the Crown acting through the Secretary of State in the context of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and Secretary of State had acted on behalf of HM the Queen in right of that territory and not of the United Kingdom. For the majority the question was the constitutional standing of the instruction: at para 19, per Lord Bingham, para 64, per Lord  Hoffmann,  and  para  79,  per  Lord  Hope.  The  argument  for  the  claimant  that  the instruction  was  given  in  the  interests  of  the  United  Kingdom  was  rejected  on  the  basis that  whether  the  Secretary  of  State’s  decision  was  motivated  by  the  wider  political  and diplomatic  interests  of  the  United  Kingdom  was  “unsuitable  for  judicial  determination” (at para 18, per Lord Bingham), the court was “neither concerned nor equipped to decide in whose interests the act was done” (at para 64, per Lord Hoffmann); or that, although the  question  might  be  justiciable,  for  it  to  be  explored  would  give  rise  to  great uncertainty;  it  was  irrelevant  because  the  question  was  simply  in  what  capacity  the instruction  was  given  by  the  Crown:  at  paras  78-79,  per  Lord  Hope.  Lord  Nicholls  of Birkenhead  and  Baroness  Hale,  dissenting,  considered  that  the  capacity  in  which  the Crown acted was irrelevant: paras 45-46, 94-95. Baroness Hale of Richmond said that to treat capacity as decisive, when the legality of the instruction could be raised in United Kingdom courts, and when the Secretary of State was answerable, if at all, to the United Kingdom  Parliament,  would  be  a  surrender  of  substance  to  form.  The  authority  of  the majority  was  weakened  when  in  R  (Bancoult)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  Foreign  and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) [2009] 1 AC 453, para 46 Lord Hoffmann said that, in the light of Finnis, Common Law Constraints: Whose Common Good Counts? (2008) Oxford Legal Studies Research Paper 10/2008 (criticising the decision of the House of Lords in Quark  and  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Bancoult  [2008]  QB  365),  he  thought  that  Lord Nicholls was right. 107.  Since  it  is  agreed  that  this  issue  does  not  arise  on  the  present  appeal,  it  is  not necessary to say more than that, as matters now stand, the approach laid down by the then majority  of  the  House  of  Lords  leads    to  the  conclusion  that  the  decisions  of  the Committee for the Affairs  of  Jersey and Guernsey and the Privy Council were taken as part  of  the  constitutional  machinery  of  the  Bailiwick  of  Guernsey  and  of  Sark  for  the approval and enactment of Laws in Sark, and that the fact that the decisions were taken by  Ministers  of  the  Crown  who  took  into  account  the  international  obligations  of  the United Kingdom is irrelevant. It would be quite wrong for the approach in Quark to be revisited on an appeal (particularly with a panel of five) in which it does not arise, and in which it is not argued that Quark was wrongly decided and ought to be reconsidered.   Page 28 \\x0c         108.  The second issue in Quark was whether the claimant had established breach of a Convention right for the purposes of section 7 of the Human Rights Act. Lord Nicholls considered  that,  even  if  the  First  Protocol  had  been  extended  to  South  Georgia  and  the South Sandwich Islands, the claimants would not have had a Convention right on which they claim damages under the Human Rights Act. He said at para 36: “The Human Rights Act is a United Kingdom statute. The Act is expressed to apply to Northern Ireland: section 22(6). It  is  not  expressed  to  apply  elsewhere  in  any  relevant respect. What, then, of Convention obligations assumed by the United Kingdom in respect of its overseas territories by making  a  declaration  under  article  56?  In  my  view  the rights brought home by the Act do not include Convention rights  arising  from  these  extended  obligations  assumed  by the United Kingdom in respect of its overseas territories. I can see no warrant for interpreting the Act as having such an  extended  territorial  reach.  If  the  United  Kingdom notifies the Secretary General of the European Council that the Convention shall apply to one of its overseas territories, the United Kingdom thenceforth assumes in respect of that territory  a  treaty  obligation  in  respect  of  the  rights  and freedoms set out in the Convention. But such a notification does  not  extend  the  reach  of  sections  6  and  7  of  the  Act. The position is the same in respect of protocols” 109.  Lord Hoffmann came to the same view on this point: “The Act is concerned only with  the  Convention  as  it  applies  to  the  United  Kingdom  and  not  by  extension  to  other territories”: para 62. Lord Hope emphasised that the United Kingdom government would not be answerable in Strasbourg if the international obligation had not been extended to the  overseas  territory,  but  he  said  that  he  agreed  with  Lord  Nicholls:  para  93.  Lord Bingham expressed no view on this point: para 26. Baroness Hale left the question open: para  98.  Lord  Hoffmann  in  R  (Bancoult)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  Foreign  and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) [2009] 1 AC 453, para 48, reiterated his view, but that too was a case in which the Convention had not been extended to the overseas territory (the British Indian Ocean Territory). 110. In R (Al-Skeini) v. Secretary of State for Defence [2008] 1 AC 153 Lord Bingham said, at para 20, that it was not clear that the view of Lord Nicholls in Quark commanded majority support. But Lord Brown (with whom Lord Carswell agreed: para 96) endorsed Lord Nicholls’ approach. He said (at para 134):   “...  there  is  a  distinction  between  rights  arising  under  the Convention  and  rights  created  by  the  Act  by  reference  to  Page 29 \\x0c           the  Convention.  A  plain  illustration  of  this  arises  from  the temporal  limitations  imposed  by  the  Act  ...  Another illustration is the Act\\'s non-applicability in article 56 cases. Consider  R  (Quark  Fishing  Ltd)  v  Secretary  of  State  for Foreign  and  Commonwealth  Affairs  ...  Even  had  the  UK extended  article  1  of  the  First  Protocol  to  [South  Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands], no claim would have been available  against  the  Secretary  of  State  under  the  Act although liable internationally  for  any  breach.  It  is  for  the  dependent territory’s  own  legislation  to  give  effect  to  Convention rights, just as for Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.” the  UK  would  clearly  have  been 111.  This  is  a  case,  by  contrast  with  those  in  which  the  point  has  been  canvassed, where  the  relevant  Convention  obligation  has  been  extended  to  a  dependency.  But  this point  does  not  arise  for  decision  on  this  appeal  for  the  principal  reason  that  it  was conceded  that  there  was  jurisdiction  to  determine  the  lawfulness  of  the  decisions  of  the Committee  and  the  Privy  Council.  It  might  conceivably  have  arisen  on  the  question  of remedy, but that too would not arise on the view of the merits expressed in this judgment. In  addition  there  would  have  been  a  separate  ground  for  the  non-applicability  of  the Human Rights Act, namely the capacity in which the decisions were taken. Consequently it would also be wrong for the question whether the claimant had established breach of a Convention  right  to  be  decided  on  an  appeal  where  it  does  not  arise  and  would  be  an academic question.  112. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.  LORD HOPE I  am  in  full  agreement  with  the  opinion  of  Lord  Collins.  I  wish  to  add  a  few 113. comments on two points only. 114.  First, while I agree that some of what Dr Slivnik (who appeared in person) said in his brief address was not relevant to the outcome of this appeal, he did bring vividly to life what it means to live in a small island community. He said that Sark works so well because of its small size. That was why it was possible to achieve such a high degree of democracy in such a small society, where everyone knows everyone else.  His experience since coming to live there was that it was possible for someone to make a much greater contribution  to  public  life  than  he  had  found  anywhere  else.  It  was  a  place  where  one  Page 30 \\x0c          could  go  round  and  talk  to  people.  One  could  have  much  greater  direct  access  to  the legislators.   115.  This  led  to  two  considerations  which  he  wished  to  stress.  The  first  was  that  it would  be  in  conflict  with  democracy  in  a  small  society  to  vest  too  much  power  in individuals.  The  powers  that  the  Reform  Law  gave  to  the  Seneschal,  the  highest  paid official on the island, were disproportionate. The second was that, as membership of the Chief  Pleas  was  unpaid,  there  was  a  very  real  problem  in  attracting  able  and  willing candidates for election. The fact that so few tenants had expressed an interest in standing tended to reinforce his perception that the Seneschal had too much power. He himself was keen to volunteer for public life. But he was prevented from doing so because, as an alien, he was not entitled to stand for election. He said that the greatest prospect in achieving reforms  that  were  truly  in  the  best  interests  of  democracy  lay  in  quashing  the  Reform Law,  so  that  the  1951  Law  could  be  restored  and  more  time  given  to  the  process  of reform. 116.  The answer to these points lies, as Lord Collins has explained so carefully, in the principles  that  are  to  be  derived  from  Article  3  of  the  First  Protocol.  As  he  has  said, electoral  rules  have  to  be  looked  at  in  the  round  and  in  the  light  of  each  state’s  own historical  and  political  factors.  Taken  in  the  round,  having  regard  to  the  things  that  the Seneschal  can  and  cannot  do  and  to  the  potential  means  of  addressing  any  abuse,  the powers that are given to him are well within the margin of appreciation allowed by that article. Dr Slivnik’s frustration at not being eligible for election is readily understandable. But there is ample authority for the proposition that the Chief Pleas’ decision granting the right  to  stand  for  elections  only  to  those  who  are  citizens  of  Sark  was  well  within  that margin of appreciation also. I agree that the appeal must be dismissed.        117.  Second, I wish to clear up any uncertainty which my remarks in R (Quark Fishing Ltd) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2006] 1 AC 529, paras 92-93 may have caused; see paras 109-110 above. As I stated in para 93 of my opinion in that case, I was in full agreement with what Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said about the territorial scope of the Human Rights Act 1998. This extended to para 36 of his opinion, where he said that notification by the United Kingdom that the Convention was to apply to its overseas territories did not extend the reach of the Act to those territories. I would respectfully  endorse  the  observation  by  Pill  LJ  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  [2009]  2  WLR 1205,  para  105  that  my  own  remarks  should  not  be  interpreted  as  meaning  that notification  attracted  the  application  of  the  Act.  What  I  was  seeking  to  show,  as  an additional reason for agreeing with Lord Nicholls, was that notification under article 56 or,  as  the  case  may  be,  article  4  of  the  First  Protocol  was  a  pre-condition  for  a consideration of that issue and that on the facts of that case this  condition could not  be satisfied.    Page 31 \\x0c         I  am  in  full  agreement  with  the  reasons  Lord  Collins  gives  for  dismissing  this 118. appeal. I can add nothing useful and for the reasons he gives I would do likewise.  LORD SCOTT  LORD BROWN 119. I have read Lord Collins’ judgment and regard it as convincing and definitive on all the issues we have to decide. With regard to the applicability of the Human Rights Act 1998, to my mind the most interesting question debated before us, tempted though I have been to address it, I am persuaded by Lord Collins (see paras 100-111 of his judgment) that it would not be right to succumb.     LORD NEUBERGER I  have  read  the  magisterial  judgment  of  Lord  Collins  and  agree  with  it. 120. Accordingly, I too would dismiss this appeal.    Page 32'}, 'press summary': {'Press summary': '1 December 2009  R (on the application of Barclay and others) v Secretary of State for Justice and others [2009] UKSC 9   On appeal from the Court of Appeal Civil Division [2008] EWCA Civ 1319', 'Justices': 'Lord Hope (Deputy President), Lord Scott, Lord Brown, Lord Neuberger, Lord Collins', 'Background to the appeal': 'Sark  is  an  island  in  the  Channel  Islands  of  about  600  inhabitants.  In  this  appeal,  Sir  David  and  Sir Frederick  Barclay  sought  to  challenge  new  constitutional  arrangements  in  Sark  contained  in  the Reform (Sark) Law 2008.    Under the Reform Law, the electorate (of about 500 people) vote for 28 members of Sark’s legislature, which is called the “Chief Pleas”. But there are two members of the Chief Pleas who are not elected.   The first is the “Seigneur” (or Lord) of Sark, who holds a title first granted by Queen Elizabeth I in the sixteenth century. Although he may speak, the Seigneur cannot vote at any meeting of the Chief Pleas, but  he  does  have  a  power  temporarily  to  veto  Ordinances  of  the  Chief  Pleas.  The  second  is  the “Seneschal”  (or  Steward),  whose  office  was  created  by  the  Crown  in  the  seventeenth  century.  The Seneschal  convenes  meetings  of  and  presides  over  the  Chief  Pleas,  but  has  no  power  to  speak  in debates  or  to  vote.  Historically,  both  the  Seigneur  and  the  Seneschal  were  able  to  vote  in  the  Chief Pleas.   The  Barclay  brothers  argued  that  the  position  of  the  Seigneur  and  the  Seneschal,  under  the  new arrangements, was incompatible with Article 3 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects “the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature”.  They  argued  that  the  effect  of  that  Article  is  that  all  members  of  a  single  chamber legislature must be elected members.    An appeal was also brought by Dr Tomas Slivnik, who wanted to stand for election to the Chief Pleas. He argued that the Reform Law discriminated against him contrary to the European Convention. He said that this was because, even though he had a right to vote as a resident, he nevertheless did not have a right to stand for election as he was a citizen of Slovenia.', 'Judgment': 'The Supreme Court held that the unelected position of the Seigneur and the Seneschal was not incompatible with Article 3 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. It held also that the restriction on Dr Slivnik’s standing for election complied with his Convention rights. The appeals were unanimously dismissed.

[References in square brackets are to paragraph numbers in the judgment].   As to whether the position of the Seneschal and the Seigneur in the Chief Pleas of Sark, as provided for in the Reform Law, was a breach of Article 3 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights:  \\uf0b7  There was no invariable rule in Article 3 of the First Protocol that all members of a legislature had to be elected irrespective of their powers and irrespective of the circumstances [67], [70].  \\uf0b7  Until 1922 the composition of the Chief Pleas reflected the feudal system in Sark and between 1922 and 2008 the feudal Tenants dominated the Chief Pleas. Against that background, and in light  generally  of  the  constitutional  history  and  the  political  factors  relevant  to  Sark,  the position of the Seigneur and the Seneschal was well within the margin of appreciation given to Contracting States to the Convention under Article 3 of the First Protocol. The free expression of the opinion of the people of Sark was not impeded by their membership of the Chief Pleas [71]-[72], [74].  \\uf0b7  The  Seigneur’s  power  temporarily  to  veto  legislation  was  proportionate  and  consistent  with Article 3 of the First Protocol. In reaching that conclusion, it was legitimate to take account of the fact that the power had not been used in modern times, and that the Seigneur had indicated it would only be used in very limited circumstances [78].   \\uf0b7  The Seneschal’s powers were those which any presiding officer would be given or would need. His position could not realistically be said to impair the essence of the rights under Article 3 of the First Protocol [83].   As to whether the prohibition imposed by the Reform Law on persons who are “aliens” from standing for election to the Chief Pleas of Sark is a breach of the right under Article 3 of the First Protocol, read alone and / or in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention:  \\uf0b7  Under the European Convention, as reflected in the decisions of the Strasbourg Court and in the  practice  of  the  members  of  the  Council  of  Europe,  it  is  citizens,  and  not  non-resident aliens, who have the right to vote and stand for election. There may be some exceptions, but the general rule is clear [93].    \\uf0b7  Article  3  of  the  First  Protocol  does  not  require  a  justification  for  qualifications  which  are stricter  for  standing  for  election  than  for  voting.  Historical  and  political  factors  have determined the definition of “alien” in UK law. Eligibility for standing for election in Sark was limited to those with a genuine connection with Sark in the form of residence or ownership of property.  It  was  clear  that  in  the  light  of  those  factors  and  the  breadth  of  the  margin  of appreciation, the exclusion of aliens from eligibility to stand for election was justifiable [95].

The  first  and  principal  question  before  us  is  whether  the  parties’  right  of “prorogation”,  to  “opt  in”  to  the  jurisdiction  of  an  EU  country  which  would  not otherwise have jurisdiction to determine a child’s future, contained in article 12 of Council  Regulation  (EC)  No  2201/2003  (“Brussels  II  Revised”),  can  apply  to  a child who is habitually resident outside the European Union. If the answer to that question is “yes”, then the second question is whether that is what has happened in this case. That depends both upon the interpretation of the criteria for opting in and upon  an  evaluation  of  what  these  parties  did.  The  first  question  is  a  good  deal easier to answer than the second.   The facts   2. The child in question was born on 27 July 2000 and is now aged nine. He was born in this country and is a British citizen. His mother originates from India but has lived in this country for many years. His father originates from Pakistan. Both are British citizens. They married in Pakistan on 28 October 1999 and later lived together in this country. They separated in September 2002 and divorced in 2003.  As  is  common,  no  orders  were  made  about  the  child  in  the  course  of  the divorce proceedings.   3. In this case there were already care proceedings on foot about the child. He was taken to hospital on 1 November 2001 and found to have several fractures to his arms. The local authority began proceedings on 6 November 2001 and a “split” hearing  was  directed.  At  the  fact-finding  hearing  in  May  2002,  District  Judge Brasse found that the injuries were non-accidental and that the father had caused them. However, at the welfare hearing in December 2002, he reviewed that finding in  the  light  of  the  new  evidence  which had  emerged  during  the welfare inquiries and decided that the mother had been responsible. At the final hearing on 22 May 2003,  he  made  an  order  that  the  child  should  live  with  his  father  and  have supervised  contact  with  his  mother  in  accordance  with  an  agreement  made between the local authority and the mother. He also made a supervision order for 12 months. That concluded the care proceedings.     4. It is an automatic condition of all residence orders that the child is not to be taken out of the jurisdiction without either the written consent of every person who has  parental  responsibility  for  the  child  or  the  leave  of  the  court:  Children  Act 1989, s 13(1). In mid 2004 the father applied for leave to take the child to live in Pakistan  with  the  father’s  mother  and  sister.  On  16  September  2004,  Hedley  J granted that leave. At the same time, the father (who was represented by counsel at  Page 2 \\x0c     The  relevant  parts  of  the  Brussels  II  Revised  Regulation  applied  from  1 the  hearing)  gave  the  conventional  undertaking  to  return  the  child  to  this jurisdiction  when  ordered  to  do  so  by  the  court.  The  order  also  provided  for interim contact with the mother until the child left the jurisdiction.   5. The  father  took  him  to  Pakistan  on  22  December  2004  and  he  has  lived there  ever  since.  It  is  common  ground  that,  whatever  the  precise  legal  test  to  be applied,  he  is  now  habitually  resident  in  Pakistan.  His  father  returned  to  this country  some  months  later.  His  mother  has  visited  him  in  Pakistan  and  he  has visited his parents here.    6. March 2005.    7. On 31 October 2007 the mother, acting in person, issued an application in the Principal Registry of the Family Division for a “contact and prohibition” order, seeking to enforce “telephone contact and as much contact as possible” and to stop the paternal grandparents encouraging the child to call them “mum” and “dad”. It is common ground between the parties that this is when the relevant proceedings began for the purposes of the jurisdictional questions before us.   8. At the first directions hearing on 5 November 2007, both parties attended, acting  in  person,  and  the  matter  was  adjourned  to  a  conciliation  hearing  on  12 December 2007. Again, both attended that hearing acting in person and an agreed order for contact was made. Among other things, the father agreed to facilitate the child visiting the UK if possible on an annual basis during his school holidays and seeing his mother then. On 15 April 2008, the mother issued a further application, seeking to “enforce and vary” the contact order so as to ensure that the child was in the UK to facilitate contact and a local authority assessment  of  the  possibility  of unsupervised contact.   9. The matter eventually came before Hedley J on 17 June 2008. The parties were still acting in person. At that stage it appeared “uncontentious” that the child should come back here in 2009, possibly for more than a visit; but the parties were “hopelessly  divided”  about  2008.  Hedley  J  remarked  that  it  was  unusual  for  the Court to be retaining jurisdiction as the child was living in Pakistan, but that “the Court  undoubtedly  does  have  jurisdiction  because  both  parties  have  not  only submitted  to  the  jurisdiction  but  have  actually  invoked  it  on  a  number  of occasions” (para 29). He directed that CAFCASS appoint a guardian for the child. He also ordered the father to bring the child into the jurisdiction in June and July 2009, the child to have reasonable contact with the mother, and the mother to be at liberty  to  visit  the  child  in  Pakistan.  She  spent  about  three  weeks  there  in  the  Page 3 \\x0c     summer  of  2008  and  saw  the  child  then  but  she  has  not  seen  him  since.  The CAFCASS  guardian  reported  in  January  2009  that  his  provisional  view  was  that the child should visit this country every other year and the mother visit Pakistan in the intervening years.   10. The matter came back before the High Court on 2 March 2009. By this time both parties were legally represented. A “position statement” filed by counsel on the father’s behalf stated that “The court has retained jurisdiction in this case and the father accepts the Court’s jurisdiction” and that “The father accepts the court has  retained  jurisdiction  to  make  orders  directed  towards  himself  in  relation  to contact”.  He  had,  however,  changed  his  mind  about  bringing  the  child  to  this country in 2009 and undertook to issue an application to set aside Hedley J’s order that he should do so. This he duly did on 4 March 2009.    11.  At  a  directions  hearing  on  12  March  2009,  Black  J  for  the  first  time questioned whether the court did indeed have jurisdiction to make orders relating to  the  child.  That  issue  was  tried  before  HHJ  Barnett,  sitting  as  a  deputy  High Court judge, on 5 and 6 May 2009. It was then common ground between counsel that Brussels II Revised did not apply. On 28 May 2009 HHJ Barnett held that the court did not have jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1986. However he also held that if the court did have jurisdiction he would not have granted a stay on the ground of forum non conveniens. The child’s guardian considered that the English court  was  the  most  appropriate  forum  to  decide  the  issues  between  the  parents, both of whom were resident here.   12. The mother appealed and for the first time it was argued on her behalf that article 12 of Brussels II Revised applied. One can only feel sympathy for the Court of  Appeal,  confronted  as  they  were  with  a  novel  and  at  first  blush  surprising argument.  Thorpe  LJ  found  it  obvious  that  HHJ  Barnett  had  reached  the  right result and “would have been dismayed had it been necessary to set aside his very sensible conclusion”: [2009] EWCA Civ 965, para 35. The House of Lords gave permission to appeal to this Court over the long vacation.   The law    13.  As amended following the implementation of Brussels II Revised, section 2 of the Family Law Act 1986 reads as follows:    “(1) A court in England and Wales shall not make a section 1(1)(a) order with respect to a child unless –   Page 4 \\x0c     (a) it has jurisdiction under the Council Regulation, or (b) the Council Regulation does not apply but –   (i) the question of making the order arises in or in connection with  matrimonial  proceedings  or  civil  partnership  proceedings and the condition in section 2A is satisfied, or  (ii)   the condition in section 3 of this Act is satisfied.”   14. The  “council  regulation”  is  Brussels  II  Revised.  A  section  1(1)(a)  order includes  a  “section  8  order  made  by  a  court  in  England  and  Wales  under  the Children  Act  1989,  other  than  an  order  varying  or  discharging  such  an  order”. Section  2A  need  not  concern  us  as  there  are  no  continuing  matrimonial proceedings  between  the  parties,  nor  were  any  orders  made  in  connection  with them.  Section  3  gives  jurisdiction  on  the  basis  that  the  child  is  either  habitually resident  in  England  and  Wales  on  the  date  of  the  application  or  (if  there  was  no application)  of  the  order,  or  was  present  here  on  that  date  and  not  habitually resident in another part of the United Kingdom.     15. It will be noted that, if Brussels II Revised applies, it governs the situation. If  some  other  EU  country  (excluding  Denmark  for  this  purpose)  has  jurisdiction under the Regulation, then this country does not. But if Brussels II Revised applies and gives this country jurisdiction, it will give jurisdiction even though the residual jurisdictional  rules  contained  in  the  1986  Act  would  not.  Only  if  Brussels  II Revised does not apply at all will the residual rules in the 1986 Act come into play.    16. cases is in article 8.1:   The  basic  rule  in  Brussels  II  Revised  governing  jurisdiction  in  children’s “The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seised.”   But that is subject to articles 9, 10 and 12. We are concerned with article 12, which deals  with  “Prorogation  of  jurisdiction”.  It  is  worth  quoting  article  12  in  full, although  articles  12.1  and  12.2  are  not  directly  relevant  in  this  case,  because  the answer  to  the  first  question  must  apply  equally  to  the  prorogation  covered  by article 12.1 as it does to the prorogation covered by article 12.3:    Page 5 \\x0c            The courts of a Member State exercising jurisdiction by virtue “1. of  Article  3  on  an  application  for  divorce,  legal  separation  or marriage annulment shall have jurisdiction in any matter relating to parental responsibility connected with that application where:  (a) relation to the child; and at  least  one  of  the  spouses  has  parental  responsibility  in (b) the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  has  been  accepted  expressly  or otherwise  in  an  unequivocal  manner  by  the  spouses  and  by  the holders of parental responsibility, at the time the court is seised, and is in the superior interests of the child. The jurisdiction conferred in paragraph 1 shall cease as soon 2. as:  (a) legal separation or marriage annulment has become final; the judgment allowing or refusing the application for divorce, in those  cases  where  proceedings  relating (b) to  parental responsibility  are  still  pending  on  the  date  referred  to  in  (a),  a judgment in these proceedings has become final; the proceedings referred to in (a) and (b) have come to an end (c) for another reason. 3. The  courts  of  a  Member  State  shall  also  have  jurisdiction  in relation  to  parental  responsibility  in  proceedings  other  than  those referred to in paragraph 1 where:  the child has a substantial connection with that Member State, (a) in particular by virtue of the fact that one of the holders of parental responsibility is habitually resident in that Member State or that the child is a national of that Member State; and (b) the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  has  been  accepted  expressly  or otherwise  in  an  unequivocal  manner  by  all  the  parties  to  the proceedings at the time the court is seised and is in the best interests of the child. 4.  Where  the  child  has  his  or  her  habitual  residence  in  the territory of a third State which is not a contracting party to the Hague  Page 6 \\x0c     Convention  of  19  October  1996  on  jurisdiction,  applicable  law, recognition,  enforcement  and  co-operation  in  respect  of  parental responsibility  and  measures  for the  protection  of  children, jurisdiction  under  this  Article  shall  be  deemed  to  be  in  the  child’s interest, in particular if it is found impossible to hold proceedings in the third State in question.”   The first question   17.  Can  article  12  apply  at  all  where  the  child  is  lawfully  resident  outside  the European Union? In my view it clearly can. There is nothing in either article 12.1 or  article  12.3  to  limit  jurisdiction  to  children  who  are  resident  within  the  EU. Jurisdiction in divorce, nullity and legal separation is governed by article 3 of the Regulation, which lists no less than seven different bases of jurisdiction. It is easy to think of cases in which a court in the EU will have jurisdiction under article 3 but one of the spouses and their children will be resident outside the EU. A court in England and Wales would have jurisdiction if the petitioning mother were living with the children in the USA and the respondent father were living in this country. A court in England and Wales would have jurisdiction if the petitioning father had lived  here  for  at  least  a  year  and  the  respondent  mother  were  living  with  the children in the USA. A court in England and Wales would have jurisdiction if the spouses  were  living  here  but  their  children  were  living  in  the  USA.  In  some  of these  cases  the  spouses  might  well  wish  to  accept  the  jurisdiction  of  the  English court  to  decide  matters  relating  to  parental  responsibility  so  that  their  children’s future  could  be  decided  in  the  same  jurisdiction  as  their  status,  property  and finances.  Professor  Rauscher  is  quite  clear  that  “the  new  rule  not  only  applies  to children  residing  in  a  Member  State  which  is  not  the  forum  State  (as  Article  3 Brussels II did) but also to children residing in Non-Member States” (T Rauscher, “Parental Responsibility Cases under the new Council Regulation ‘Brussels IIA’”, The  European  Legal  Forum,  1-2005,  37  –  46  at  p  40).  There  is  nothing  to differentiate article 12.3 from article 12.1 in this respect.   18. This view of the matter is confirmed, if the “third State” which is referred to in  article  12.4  means  a  “non-Member  State”.  The  term  “third  State”  occurs  only twice in Brussels II Revised. Article 61 provides that:   “As concerns the relation with the Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children, this Regulation shall apply:   Page 7 \\x0c     (a)  where the child concerned has his or her habitual residence on the territory of a Member State;  as  concerns  the  recognition  and  enforcement  of  a  judgment (b) given  in  a  court  of  a  Member  State  on  the  territory  of  another Member  State,  even  if  the  child  concerned  has  his  or  her  habitual residence on the territory of a third State which is a contracting Party to the Convention.”   If “third State” in article 61 referred to some other Member State, there would be no need for paragraph (b) because paragraph (a) would cover all cases. But in any event, both article 61 and article 12.4 are looking at the relationship between the Regulation and the 1996 Hague Convention. 16 countries have so far ratified that Convention,  half  within  and  half  outside  the  EU  (the  UK  has  signed  but  not ratified;  Pakistan  has  done  neither).  If  the  child  is  habitually  resident  in  “a  third State”  which  is  a  party  to  the  1996  Convention,  the  Regulation  applies  to  the recognition and enforcement in one Member State of a judgment given in another Member  State.  If  the  child  is  habitually  resident  in  a  third  State  which  is  not  a party to the Convention, article 12.4 lays down a presumption that it will be in the interests  of  the  child  for  the  EU  State  to  assume  jurisdiction  if  the  parties  have agreed to accept it. All of this makes sense if the “third State” lies outside the EU but  would  add  nothing  if  it  lies  within  it.  Indeed,  why  limit  the  presumption  in article 12.4 to the rare case where there are three EU States involved but not apply it  to  the  more  common  situation  where  there  are  two?  Nor  does  the  reference  in article  12.4  to  the  impossibility  of  holding proceedings in the “third State” make much  sense  within  the  EU.  Professor  Rauscher  predicts  that  “Most  cases  under Article  12(3)  will  probably  feature  strange  situations  of  habitual  residence particularly  with  children  being  nationals  of  a  Member  State  but  residing  farther abroad in countries with unreliable judicial structures” (loc cit, p 41).    19. There is no case law on the meaning of “third State” in Brussels II Revised. For what it is worth, the Practice Guide to the Regulation states that the option of voluntarily  accepting  the  jurisdiction  of  a  Member  State  “is  not  limited  to situations  where  the  child  is  habitually  resident  within  the  territory  of  a  Member State”  (p  45).  Reunite  have  helpfully  also  drawn  our  attention  to  other  sources emanating from the EU which define the term to mean a State outside the EU: see, for  example,  the  Community  Research  and  Development  Information  Service (CORDIS),  which  uses  the  term  “Third  State”  to  mean  a  state  that  is  neither  a Member State nor an Associated State.     Page 8 \\x0c     20. This  merely  reinforces  the  conclusion  arrived  at  on  ordinary  principles  of construction  that  article  12  can  apply  to  children  who  are  habitually  resident outside the EU.   The second question   21. The  second  question  is  whether  the  criteria  in  article  12.3  are  made  out. Paragraph (a) of article 12.3 requires that the child have a substantial connection with the Member State in question, in particular by virtue of the fact that one of the holders  of  parental  responsibility  is  habitually  resident  in  that  State  or  that  the child  is  a  national  of  that  State.  This  is  clearly  satisfied  in  this  case.  At  the  time these  proceedings  began,  both  parents  were  habitually  resident  in  the  United Kingdom and the child was and is a British national.   22.  More complicated questions arise under paragraph (b) of article 12.3. This can be broken down into two components: first, that “the jurisdiction of the courts has  been  accepted  expressly  or  otherwise  in  an  unequivocal  manner  by  all  the parties  to  the  proceedings  at  the  time  the  court  is  seised”;  and  second,  that  the jurisdiction of the court “is in the best interests of the child”. Each of these raises interesting subsidiary questions.   “At the time the court is seised”   23. The most difficult questions are posed by the words “at the time the court is seised”. The first is whether they refer to a moment in time or, as held by the Court of  Appeal,  to  any  time  while  the  proceedings  are  continuing.  As  a  general proposition, it should be clear at any particular point during the proceedings, and preferably  from  the  outset,  whether  or  not  the  court  has  jurisdiction.  Certainly  a party who has once accepted jurisdiction should not be able to withdraw it at any time  before  the  conclusion  of  the  case.  Acceptance  of  jurisdiction  must  include acceptance of the court’s decision whatever it may be. Otherwise there would be no point in submitting to the court’s jurisdiction.     24. time. This provides that:   It  is  clear  from  article  16  that  a  court  is  seised  at  a  particular  moment  in “A court shall be deemed to be seised:   Page 9 \\x0c     (a) at the time when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent  document  is  lodged  with  the  court,  provided  that  the applicant  has  not  subsequently  failed  to  take  the  steps  he  was required to take to have service effected on the respondent; or  (b)  if  the  document  has  to  be  served  before  being  lodged  with  the court, at the time when it is received by the authority responsible for service,  provided  that  the  applicant  has  not  subsequently  failed  to take the steps he was required to take to have the document lodged with the court.”   From this it is clear that the time of seisin is fixed when the document initiating the proceedings  is  lodged  with  the  court  or,  if  it  has  to  be  served  before  lodging,  is received  by  the  authority  responsible  for  service,  although  in  each  case  the  court may  not  actually  be  seised  if  the  applicant  does  not  take  the  steps  required  to inform either the respondent or the court. There has to be a fixed time of seisin for the  purpose  of  the  rule  in  article  19,  that  the  court  “second  seised”  of  divorce, separation  or  nullity  proceedings  shall  decline  jurisdiction  in  favour  of  the  court “first seised”.   25. There  was  some  debate  about  what  constituted  “the  proceedings”  in  this case.  In  one  sense,  no  order  about  the  upbringing  of  a  child  is  ever  final.  The parties can always agree to make different arrangements or bring the matter back to court for the court to do so. But the reality in this case was that there were care proceedings brought by the local authority in 2002 which were concluded by the residence,  contact  and  supervision  orders  made  in  2003.  There  were  then  private law proceedings brought by the father to enable him to take the child abroad to live which  were  concluded  by  the  orders  made  by  Hedley  J  on  16  September  2004. There  were  then  new  proceedings  brought  by  the  mother  in  2007,  the  object  of which  was  to  make  provision  for  her  contact  with  the  child  which  had  not  been done in the 2004 order. It is common ground between the parties that these are “the proceedings” for this purpose and in my view that is correct. It follows, therefore, that the court became seised of this matter on 31 October 2007.   26.  But the next question is “what do those words describe?” Do they, as had been assumed by all before the hearing in this Court, describe the time at which the parties have accepted jurisdiction? Or do they, as proposed by Mr Setright QC on behalf  of  the  interveners  Reunite,  describe  the  parties  whose  acceptance  is required? In other words, does article 12.3(b) mean “the jurisdiction of the courts was accepted when the proceedings began by all those who were then parties”? Or does it mean “the jurisdiction of the courts has been accepted at any time after the proceedings have begun by all those who were parties when they began”?  Page 10 \\x0c     27. There is much to be said for Mr Setright’s interpretation, both linguistically and in practice. He draws our attention to the German text of article 12.3(b), which begins “alle Parteien des Verfahrens zum Zeitpunkt der Anrufung des Gerichts . . . ”. However, given what to us is the reverse word order of most German sentences, it would be unwise to place too much reliance upon this. The French, Italian and Spanish texts follow the same word order as the English and are therefore equally ambiguous.  Another  linguistic  clue  could  be  the  particular  tense  used  in  the English  text.  “Has  been  accepted”  is  more consistent with the possibility of later acceptance of jurisdiction. If it had been intended to limit acceptance to the exact time of seisin, it would have been more natural to use the words “was accepted”. Once  again,  however,  it  might  be  unwise  to  place  too  much  reliance  upon  the precise  tense  chosen  in  the  English  text,  given  that  other  European  languages  do not have the same variety of ways of referring to something which has happened in the past.    28. The practical attraction of Mr Setright’s argument is that this interpretation would enable the court considering whether there has been unequivocal acceptance of jurisdiction to take into account the parties’ conduct after as well as before the proceedings have begun. Given that the court may be seised before the respondent knows anything about the proceedings (as may well have happened here), it should be possible for the respondent to accept jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner  by  the  way  in  which  he  reacts  to  the  proceedings  when  he  learns  about them. If the respondent is indeed content to accept the jurisdiction of the court it should be possible for him to indicate that, either expressly or by his conduct, even though he had not addressed his mind to the matter before the court became seised. Otherwise the scope of both article 12.1 and article 12.3 would be limited (in the vast majority of cases) to cases where there was a written agreement in place when the proceedings were instituted. Admittedly, this was said by the Court of Appeal in Bush v Bush [2008] EWCA Civ 865, [2008] 2 FLR 1437, at para 53, to be the “paradigm  case”  but  there  is  no  reason  why  it  should  be  virtually  the  only  case. Prorogation  of  jurisdiction  under  article  17  of  the  Brussels  Convention  on Jurisdiction  and  the  Enforcement  of  Judgments  in  Civil and Commercial Matters 1968  was  limited  to  agreements  in  writing  or  in  a  form  which  accords  with  the practice  of  the  international  trade  or  commerce  in  question.  Prorogation  under article  12  is  not  so  limited.  It  is  clearly  contemplated  that  conduct  other  than express  agreement  can  constitute  unequivocal  acceptance  of  the  jurisdiction.  Furthermore, as Lord Collins demonstrates at paragraph 53, there is no reason in principle why there should not be acceptance of jurisdiction after the proceedings have began.   29. Professor  Rauscher  accepts  that  jurisdiction  must  be  accepted  at  the  time the court is seised but argues that too literal an interpretation would render article 12.1   Page 11 \\x0c     “almost  useless.  The  parties  to  a  divorce  proceeding  won’t  even think about jurisdiction as to parental responsibility before the court is  seised.  Therefore  a  more  liberal  interpretation  is  advisable.  The wording should probably be understood in the sense of ‘at the time the  court  has  been  seised’, thereby  excluding  any  binding prorogation before the case has been brought to court.” (p 40)   So now we have a suggestion that prior agreement is not the paradigm case and the parties’  conduct  once  the  proceedings  have  begun  is  what  matters.  After  all,  the parallel with agreements under the Brussels Convention is not close in matrimonial and family cases, where it is less common (and in some cases not possible) to have a binding agreement between spouses or parents before proceedings have begun.    30. There is, however, another way of achieving much the same result. Article 16 fixes which is first in time for priority purposes under article 19. But it contains within itself the possibility that apparent seisin may not mature into actual seisin unless  the  applicant  later  effects  service  or  lodges  the  document  with  the  court. Whether this is regarded as a condition defeasant makes no difference: the result in the actual decision depends upon what happens later. It might be possible to take a similar approach to prorogation, so that the apparent seisin when the application is lodged does not mature into actual seisin until the respondent is served and has an opportunity to indicate whether or not he  accepts  jurisdiction.  This  too  would  be consistent with the English use of “has been” rather than “was”.          31.  As will become apparent shortly, we do not need to resolve this question in this  particular  case,  because  we  have  unequivocal  acceptance  of  the  jurisdiction both  before  and  after  the  proceedings  were  begun.  Moreover,  it  may  not  matter much  in  practice.  Even  if  the  words  “at  the  time  the  court  is  seised”  qualify  the parties’  acceptance,  and  refer  only  to  the  precise  date  when  the  proceedings  are initiated  rather  than  to  once  they  have  begun,  the  court  is  entitled  to  look  at  the parties’ conduct after the proceedings have begun in order to decide whether they had  accepted  jurisdiction  at  the  time  the  proceedings  did  begin.  There  is  nothing unusual about this. Courts often take into account later behaviour as evidence of an earlier state of affairs.   32.  Whichever is the correct interpretation, the acceptance in question must be that  of  the  parties  to  the  proceedings  at  the  time  when  the  court  is  seised.  Later parties cannot come along and upset the agreement which the original parties have made.  In  this  case,  as  it  happens,  the  child  was  later  made  a  party  to  the proceedings.  Brussels  II  Revised  rightly  places  great  stress  on  the  importance  of the  voice  of  the  child  in  proceedings  about  his  future:  see  paragraph  19  of  the Preamble  and  article  11.2  dealing  with  the  return  of  children  under  the  Hague  Page 12 \\x0c     Convention  on  the  Civil  Aspects  of  International  Child  Abduction  1980.  But  the way  in  which  the  child  is  heard  will  depend  upon  national  procedures.  As  was made  plain  by  the  House  of  Lords  in  In  re  D  (A  Child)  (Abduction:  Rights  of Custody) [2006] UKHL 51, [2007] 1 AC 619, para 60, there are different ways of doing  this,  ranging  from  full  scale  legal  representation  of  the  child,  through independent expert reporting, to a face to face  interview  with  the  judge.  It  is  not usually necessary for the child to become a full party to proceedings between his parents, although of course it can and should be done in an appropriate case. The participation of the child is aimed at helping the court decide what outcome to the proceedings will be in the best interests of the child. It is usually less relevant to questions of jurisdiction.   Acceptance   33. The  father  expressly  accepted  the  court’s  jurisdiction  in  the  position statement  put  before  the  court  by  his  counsel  for  the  hearing  on  2  March  2009. This is scarcely surprising, as all his conduct up until that time had been consistent with  this  stance.  He  appeared  before  the  court  in  response  to  the  mother’s application.  He  participated  in  a  conciliation  appointment  on  12  December  2007 and consented to the order then made. He participated in the hearing before Hedley J on 17 June 2008. At that stage he was  acting in person. But the solicitors who had appeared for him in the care proceedings and their aftermath then came on the record for the purpose of his application to set aside Hedley J’s order that he bring the  child  back  into  the  jurisdiction  in  2009.  No  objection  was  then  taken  to  the court’s jurisdiction. Far from it. Counsel was instructed for the hearing before the Deputy High Court Judge on 2 March 2009 and expressly accepted jurisdiction on his behalf.   34.  All  of  this  conduct  indicates  his  acceptance  of  jurisdiction  both  expressly and in an unequivocal manner from the outset of the proceedings. He recanted only when the court itself indicated that there might not be any basis upon which there could  be  jurisdiction.  But  there  was  also  a  binding  prior  acceptance.  On  16 September  2004,  with  the  benefit  of  legal  advice,  he  gave  an  undertaking  to  the court to return the child to this jurisdiction when called upon to do so. The object of the proceedings was to enable him to take the child to live in Pakistan and thus lawfully to establish a habitual residence outside the jurisdiction. Yet at the same time he was undertaking to bring the child back when required by the court to do so. This inevitably involved accepting the court’s jurisdiction to make an order in relation, not only to him, but to the child.    35. In my view, the jurisdiction of the English courts has been accepted by the father, both expressly and otherwise in an unequivocal manner. This is so whatever  Page 13 \\x0c     interpretation is placed upon article 12.3, but the diversity of views expressed by this court indicates that the interpretation is not acte clair and may have to be the subject of a reference to the European Court of Justice in another case. But I would favour  an  interpretation  which  catered  both  for  a  binding  acceptance  before  the proceedings began and for an unequivocal acceptance once they had begun.    “In the best interests of the child”   36. The  final  requirement  in  article  12.3  is  that  the  jurisdiction  of  the  English courts should be in the best interests of the child. Nothing turns, in my view, on the difference  between  “the  best  interests  of  the  child”  in  article  12.3,  “the  superior interests of the child” in article 12.1 and “the child’s interest” in article 12.4. They must mean the same thing, which is that it is in the child’s interests for the case to be determined in the courts of this country rather than elsewhere. This question is quite  different  from  the  substantive  question  in  the  proceedings,  which  is  “what outcome to these proceedings will be in the best interests of the child?” It will not depend upon a profound investigation of  the child’s situation  and  upbringing  but upon the sort of considerations which come into play when deciding upon the most appropriate forum. The fact that the parties have submitted to the jurisdiction and are  both  habitually  resident  within  it  is  clearly  relevant  though  by  no  means  the only factor.   37. In  this  case  there  are  two  reasons  to  conclude  that  the  exercise  of jurisdiction  in  this  country  would  be  in  the  child’s  interests.  The  first  is  the presumption in article 12.4. Although expressed as a “deeming” provision, no-one suggests  that  this  is  irrebuttable.  But  it  makes  sense.  If  the  child  is  habitually resident in a country outside the EU which, like Pakistan, is not a party to the 1996 Hague  Convention  on  jurisdiction,  applicable  law,  recognition,  enforcement  and co-operation  in  respect  of  parental  responsibility  and  measures  for  the  protection of children, then even if the EU country in question is a party to that Convention, there  would  be  no  provision  for  recognition  and  enforcement  of  one  another’s orders.  If,  therefore,  the  parties  have  accepted  the  jurisdiction  of  an  EU  State,  it makes  sense  for  that  State  to  determine  the  issue.  The  difficulty  or  otherwise  of holding the proceedings in the third State in question are obviously relevant. It is not  suggested  that  it  would  be  impossible  to  hold  these  proceedings  in  Pakistan, but  while  neither  party  has  had  difficulty  with  the  proceedings  here,  the  mother would certainly face difficulties litigating in Pakistan.   38. The other factor in this case is the very proper stance taken by the child’s guardian ad litem. When the issue of forum non conveniens was ventilated before HHJ Barnett in the High Court, the guardian took the view that on balance it would be better for the case to be heard here. The nub of the issue is the contact which the  Page 14 \\x0c     child should have with his mother in this country. Any continuing risks associated with  that  contact  will  be  better  assessed  here  and  any safeguards  will  need  to  be put  in  place  here.  Inquiries  in  Pakistan  can  be  made  through  international  social services or other agencies.   39.  Of course, the difficulties of enforcement must also be taken into account. But  it  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  contact  orders  have  always  been  enforced  in personam, against the person to whom they are addressed. Unlike residence orders, they  are  not  enforced  by  the  physical  transport  of  the  child  from  one  place  to another.  The  court  is  bound  to  view  with  some  scepticism  the  protestations  of  a father, who has the benefit of an order that the child is to live with him, that he will be  unable  in  practice  to  secure  the  child’s  compliance  with  an  order  for  contact with the mother. It may be so but it is not very likely.   40.  But this is to anticipate the outcome of the court’s investigation into what will be in the best interests of this child as he grows up. Is he to make a clean break from the past and be cut off from his mother and his mother’s family indefinitely? Or should he be enabled to have a relationship with both sides of his heritage and in due course to form his own opinions of his mother? If the latter, how practically can  that  be  facilitated?  All  of  that  lies in  the  future.  There  are  many  conclusions which  the  court  hearing  this  case  might  reach.  Among  them  is  an  order  that  it would  be  better  for  the  child  to  make  no  order  at  all:  Children  Act  1989,  s  1(5). But  this  is  not  a  refusal  of  jurisdiction  (cf  Owusu  v  Jackson  (Case  C-281/02) [2005] QB 801). It is a positive conclusion, reached after the court has exercised its jurisdiction to hear and determine the case, that in all the circumstances it will be better for the child to make no further order about his future. It is impossible at this stage to speculate upon how likely that will be.   The Pakistan Protocol   41. Thorpe  LJ  was  understandably  troubled  about  the  implications  for  the “Pakistan Protocol” if the English courts were to accept jurisdiction in respect of a child  who  was  habitually  resident  in  Pakistan.  We  have  had  the  benefit  of  an intervention from Reunite, an organisation with great knowledge and experience in the  field  of  international  child  abduction,  and  represented  by  lawyers  who  also have knowledge and experience of how these things work on the ground.   42. The  UK-Pakistan  Judicial  Protocol  on  Children  Matters  is  not  an international  agreement  between  States.  It  is  an  understanding  first  reached  in January 2003 between the then President of the Family Division of the High Court in England and Wales and the then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,  Page 15 \\x0c     supplemented in September 2003 by guidelines for judicial co-operation to which Judges  from  the  Court  of  Session  in  Scotland  and  the  High  Court  in  Northern Ireland were also party. It was agreed that “in normal circumstances the welfare of a  child  is  best  determined  by  the  courts  of  the  country  of  the  child’s habitual/ordinary  residence”  (para  1).  Hence,  if  a  child  is  wrongfully  removed from  his  country  of  ordinary  residence,  the  courts  of  the  country  to  which  he  is taken  should  not  ordinarily  exercise  jurisdiction  save  for  the  purpose  of  sending the  child  back  (para  2).  The  same  should  apply  if  a  child  is  brought  from  one country  to  the  other  for  the  purposes  of  contact,  and  is  then  wrongfully  retained (para  3).  This  very  largely  reflects  the  principal  provisions  of  the  Hague Convention on Child Abduction.   43.  Neither of the two substantive paragraphs is directly applicable to this case. There has been no abduction or wrongful retention. We are concerned only with a very  limited  exception,  in  far  from  “normal”  circumstances,  to  the  general statement  in  paragraph  1.  The  two  can,  as  Mr  Setright  pointed  out,  complement one  another.  The  courts  in  Pakistan  might  welcome  the  fact  that  the  courts  in England  had  investigated  the  situation  here  and  put  in  place  safeguards  which would enable the child to visit his mother and other members of his family in this country  in  safety.  The  Protocol  would  operate  to  secure  his  prompt  return  to Pakistan  after  any  such  visit.  Alternatively,  the  court  in  this  country  might,  after beginning  its  investigation,  conclude  that,  had  this  been  a  case  within  the  EU,  it would  have  been  appropriate to  invoke  the  procedure  in  article  15  of  Brussels  II Revised, for requesting the courts of another Member State which is “better placed to  hear  the  case”  to  assume  jurisdiction.  The  Protocol,  with  the  associated Guidelines  for  judicial  co-operation,  provides  the  ideal  vehicle  for  achieving  this outside  the  EU.  In  the  view  of  Reunite,  therefore,  far  from  undermining  the Protocol, article 12 can work harmoniously with it.    44. In any event, it has to be acknowledged that the proper interpretation of the Brussels  II  Revised  Regulation  cannot  be  affected  by  the  terms  of  a  private agreement between the judiciaries of one Member State and a non-Member State.   Conclusion    45. courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction in this case.            For these reasons, therefore, I would allow this appeal and declare that the  Page 16 \\x0c     I  agree  with  Lady  Hale  that  the  appeal  should  be  allowed  and  that  the I  agree  with  Lady  Hale  that  the  appeal  should  be  allowed,  for  the  reasons LORD HOPE   46. given by her and by Lord Collins.    LORD COLLINS   47. declaration proposed by her should be made.   48. There is something to be said for the view that the proceedings began with the father’s application in mid-2004 for leave to take the child to live in Pakistan. If  that  view  were  right,  then  the  proceedings  would  have  commenced  before  the Brussels  II  Revised  Regulation  (Council  Regulation  (EC)  2201/2203)  became applicable  in  March  2005.  The  then  existing  Brussels  II  Regulation  (Council Regulation  (EC)  1347/2000)  did  not  deal  with  matters  of  parental  responsibility outside  the  context  of  matrimonial  proceedings,  and  the  court  would  have  had jurisdiction on the basis of the then habitual residence or presence of the child in England: Family Law Act 1986, sections 2 and 3. But as a matter of English law, the  mother’s  application  in  2007,  was  treated,  and  is  to  be  treated,  as  a  new proceeding.  Since  it  was  issued  after  the  Brussels  II  Revised  Regulation  became applicable, there must be a basis of jurisdiction in that Regulation.   49. The  general  rule  under  the  Brussels  II  Revised  Regulation  is  that  the Member State in which the child has his or her habitual residence has jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility: Article 8(1). In the present case it is common ground that the child is habitually resident in Pakistan, where his residence reflects “integration in a social and family environment”: In re A (Case C-523/07) [2009] 2 FLR  1,  at  para  38. Consequently,  the  English  court  will  have  jurisdiction  only  if one of the exceptions to the general rule applies.   50. The only potentially relevant exception is in Article 12 (which is set out in full by Lady Hale at para 16). Article 12 deals with prorogation of jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility both in matrimonial proceedings and in separate proceedings. These are not matrimonial proceedings, and the only available basis of jurisdiction, if any, is in Article 12(3). Where there has been a submission to the jurisdiction within the terms of Article 12(3), the court will have jurisdiction if it “is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  child”.  Where  the  child  has  his  or  her  habitual residence  in  the  territory  of  a  “third  State”  which  is  not  a  party  to  the  Hague  Page 17 \\x0c     Convention  of  1996,  jurisdiction  under  Article  12  “shall  be  deemed  to  be  in  the child’s  interest”,  in  particular  if  it  is  impossible  to  hold  proceedings  in  the  third State in question: Article 12(4). There is no significance in the difference between “best  interests”  in  Article  12(3)  and  “superior  interests”  in  Article  12(1).  Other language versions use the identical term for both: supérieur in French, superiore in Italian,  and  superior  in  Spanish.  It  is  also  plain  from  the  context  and  from  other language versions that “shall be deemed” means no more than “shall be presumed” and that the presumption is rebuttable: est présumée/si presume/se presumirà. Lady Hale has shown that “third State” means a State which is not a Member State for the purposes of the Brussels II Revised Regulation. On Article 12(4) see Professor Alegria Borrás, in Brussels II bis: its Impact and Application in the Member States (ed. Boele-Woelki and Gonzales Beilfuss, 2007), 3 at 14-15.   51.  The  question  is  whether  “the  jurisdiction  of  the  [English  court]  has  been accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seised…”. The difficulty arises from the use of the words “at the time the court is seised.” Does the use of those words in the place in which they occur mean that it is necessary that the acceptance of jurisdiction by all parties must take place, or must have taken place, at the time the court is seised, which  by  Article  16  is,  in  a  case  of  this  kind,  “the  time  when  the  document instituting  the  proceedings  …  is  lodged  with  the  court  ...”?  Or  are  those  words intended  simply  to  identify  the  parties  “at  the  time  the  court  is  seised”  whose acceptance of jurisdiction is required, as the German version of the Regulation (but not the English, French, Italian, or Spanish versions) suggests?   52. The  answer  to  this  question  must  be  found  in  the  light  of  Article  12  as  a whole  in  the  context  of  the  Regulation  as  a  whole,  and  in  the  light  of  the instruments which preceded it.   53. The Brussels Convention and the Brussels I Regulation (Council Regulation (EC)  44/2001)  each  contain  sections  on  prorogation  of  jurisdiction  by  prior agreement  (Article  17  and  23  respectively)  and  by  appearance  after  the proceedings  have  commenced  (Articles  18  and  24).  They  both  show  that,  as  is obvious,  there  is  no  reason  in  principle  why  there  should  not  be  acceptance  of jurisdiction after the commencement, or service, of proceedings.   54. The basic rule of jurisdiction in the 1996 Hague Convention is the habitual residence of the child; but where the courts of a Contracting State are exercising jurisdiction  in  matrimonial  proceedings,  they  may  take  measures  directed  to  the protection of a child habitually resident in another Contracting State if   Page 18 \\x0c     at the time  of  commencement  of the “a proceedings,  one  of  his  or  her  parents  habitually resides  in  that  State  and  one  of  them  has  parental responsibility in relation to the child, and  the jurisdiction of these authorities to take such b measures has been accepted by the parents, as well as by any other person who has parental responsibility in relation to the child, and is in  the  best  interests  of  the child.” (Article 10)   55.  A draft Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments  in  matrimonial  matters  was  approved  by  the  EU  Council  on  28  May 1998 ([1998] OJ C221), but was superseded by the Brussels II Regulation in 2000. Neither  the  draft  Convention  nor  the  Brussels  II  Regulation  contained  provision for  matters  of  parental  responsibility  outside  the  context  of  matrimonial proceedings.  Article  3(2)  of  the  draft  Convention  (in  the  same  terms  as  what became  Article  3  of  the  Brussels  II  Regulation)  provides  that  the  courts  of  a Member  State  have  jurisdiction  in  relation  to  matters  of  parental  responsibility where the child is habitually resident in another Member State and “(a) at least one of  the  spouses  has  parental  responsibility  in  relation  to  the  child  and,  (b)  the jurisdiction  of  the  courts  has  been  accepted  by  the  spouses  and  is  in  the  best interests of the child.”    56. This provision was modelled on Article 10(1) of the Hague Convention: see the  Report  by  Professor  Alegria  Borrás  on  the  draft  Convention,  para  38.  It  is therefore apparent that there was no suggestion that the acceptance of jurisdiction under Article 3 of the draft Convention or of the Brussels II Regulation had to be prior to, or at the time of, commencement of the proceedings.   57. The  Commission  proposal  for  what  became  the  Brussels  II  Revised Regulation was presented on 17 May 2002: COM(2002) 222 final/2. The proposal in relation to what became Article 12(1) in the Regulation provided for jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility where the child was habitually resident in one of  the  Member  States,  at  least  one  of  the  spouses  had  parental  responsibility  in relation to the child and “if the jurisdiction of the courts has been accepted by the spouses and is in the best interests of the child” (Article 12(1)(c)). The proposal in relation to what became Article 12(3) provided that the courts of a Member State would have jurisdiction where “all holders of parental responsibility have accepted jurisdiction at the time the court is seised” (Article 12(2)(a)), where the child had a  Page 19 \\x0c     substantial  connection  with  that  State  (in  particular  where  one  of  the  holders  of parental  responsibility  was  habitually  resident  there,  or  the  child  was  a  national) and  jurisdiction  was  in  the  best  interests  of  the  child.  Article  12(4)  of  the  draft provided: “For the purposes of this Article the appearance of a holder of parental responsibility before a court shall not be deemed in itself to constitute acceptance of the court’s jurisdiction.” The draft contained in Article 16 the same provision as to date of seisin as the Regulation.    58. This suggests that the Commission’s intention was to require acceptance of jurisdiction at or before the date of seisin, and the Commission’s Practice Guide on the Brussels II Revised Regulation (pp 16-17), which is of course not authoritative, expresses the view (in relation to both Article 12(1) and Article 12(3)) that it is at the time the court is seised when the judge has to determine whether the relevant parties have accepted the jurisdiction either explicitly or otherwise unequivocally.   59. If this is the correct interpretation of Article 12(1) and Article 12(3) it leads to a result which does not commend itself to common sense. There is no reason in principle why there should not be provision for acceptance of jurisdiction after the commencement  of  proceedings,  as  Article  18  of  the  Brussels  Convention  and Article 24 of the Brussels I Regulation show.   60. In  Bush  v  Bush  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  865,  [2008]  2  FLR  1437,  para  53  I expressed the view that the paradigm case for acceptance of jurisdiction would be actual  agreement  by  the  parents  at  the  time  the  matrimonial  proceedings  were instituted.  The  question  in  that  case  was  not  the  time  when  acceptance  of jurisdiction was to be tested but whether the steps taken by the father amounted to an acceptance of the jurisdiction of the English court.   61. Lady Hale has referred (at 29) to Rauscher, Parental Responsibility Cases under the new Council Regulation “Brussels IIA”, in European Legal Forum (E) I-2005, 35 at 40. He points out, in relation to Article 12(1) that if “at the time the court is seised” is to be understood literally, only an acceptance before the relevant steps  under  Article  16  are  taken  would  be  sufficient.  In  practice  such  an interpretation would render Article 12(1) almost useless. The parties to a divorce proceeding  will  not  think  about  jurisdiction  as  regards  parental  responsibility before  the  court  is  seised.  He  suggests  a  more  liberal  interpretation,  so  that  it would  be  understood  in  the  sense  of  “at  the  time  the  court  has  been  seised”, thereby  not  requiring  prorogation  before  the  case  has  been  brought  to  court.  As soon  as  the  case  is  pending,  consensus  can  be  achieved  (and  other  holders  of parental responsibility must also agree). He suggests the same solution for Article 12(3).   Page 20 \\x0c     62.  Another way of approaching Article 12 is to treat the words “at the time the court is seised” as qualifying the words “by the holders of parental responsibility” in Article 12(1) and the words “all the parties to the proceedings” in Article 12(3). In each case this would be a sensible  construction,  and  would be consistent with the  approach  in  the  Brussels  Convention,  the  Brussels  I  Regulation,  the  Hague Convention,  and  the  Brussels  II  Regulation.  It  would  also  be  consistent  with  the German  version  of  the  Brussels  II  Revised Regulation.  It  is  well  established  that provisions of EU law must be interpreted and applied uniformly in the light of the versions  in  all  the  official  languages:  see,  among  many  others,  Dirk  Endendijk  (Case C-187/07) [2008] ECR I-2115, at paras 22-24. In the context of Article 18 of the Brussels Convention the European Court adopted the French version as being more in keeping with the objectives and spirit of the Convention: Elefanten Schuh GmbH v Jacqmain (Case 150/80) [1981] ECR 1671, at para 14.    63. This  solution  is  an  attractive  one,  but  it  is  by  no  means  an  inevitable  or  a clear  one,  and,  if  the  appeal  depended  on  whether  it  was  right,  it  would  be necessary to make a reference to the European Court under Articles 68 and 234 of the EC Treaty.   64.  But it is not necessary for this important question to be decided because on the  facts  it  is  clear  that  as  at  the  date  the  court  was  seised  with  the  mother’s proceedings in 2007, the father had unequivocally accepted the court’s jurisdiction in  his  own  prior  application  and  that  everything  he  did  after  the  mother’s application  confirmed  his  acceptance  of  the  jurisdiction.  The  mother  has  plainly accepted the jurisdiction of the court by making her application in October 2007. Nor  can  there  be  any  doubt  that  the  father  has  “in  an  unequivocal  manner” accepted  the  jurisdiction  of  the  English  court  to  deal  with  matters  of  parental responsibility. On his own application in 2004 he gave an undertaking to the court to return the child from Pakistan to England if ordered by the court so to do. When the mother issued her own application in 2007, the father attended a hearing when an  agreed  order  for  contact  was  made.  He  appeared  at  a  hearing  in  2008  before Hedley J when it was ordered that the mother could visit the child in Pakistan, and that he should bring the child to England in June/July 2009. Finally, counsel stated in March 2009 on the father’s behalf that he accepted the court’s jurisdiction, and that  the  court  retained  jurisdiction  to  make contact orders directed to him. All of those  steps  confirmed  what  was  apparent  and  inevitable  when  the  mother  issued her application, namely that the father was already subject to the jurisdiction of the court and had accepted it in relation to matter of parental responsibility. There was, therefore,  in  the  circumstances  of  the  case  an  unequivocal  acceptance  of  the court’s jurisdiction at the date of seisin.      Page 21 \\x0c     I also agree with Lady Hale that the appeal should be allowed and that the LORD KERR   65. declaration proposed by her should be made.   I wish to say but a few words on the approach to the interpretation of article 66. 12.1  and  12.3  of  Council  Regulation  (EC)  No  2201/2003.  I  consider  that  the interpretation  discussed  by  Lord  Collins  in  paragraph  62  of  his  judgment  (which was  that  advanced  by  Mr  Setright  QC  on  behalf  of  the  intervener)  is  the  correct one.   67. The  structure  of  both  article  12.1  and  article  12.3,  if  closely  examined, support that conclusion, in my opinion. Article 12.1 (b) provides that the courts of a Member State exercising jurisdiction by virtue of article 3 on an application for divorce  etc  shall  have  jurisdiction  in  relation  to  any  matter  relating  to  parental responsibility connected with the application where at least one of the spouses has parental responsibility in relation to the child and: -   spouses  and  by “the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  has  been  accepted expressly  or  otherwise  in  an  unequivocal  manner  by the the  holders  of  parental responsibility, at the time the court is seised, and is in the best interests of the child.”   68. If  it  had  been  intended  that  the  words,  “at  the  time  the  court  is  seised” should  qualify  the  words,  “accepted  expressly  or  otherwise  in  an  unequivocal manner”,  the  composition  of  the  sentence  would  surely  have  been  different.  To achieve that result the provision should have read thus: -   “the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  has  been  accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time that the court is seised by the spouses and by the holders  of  parental  responsibility  and  is  in  the  best interests of the child.”   69. The  juxtaposition  of  the  phrase,  “at  the  time  the  court  is  seised”  with  the preceding, “the holders of parental responsibility” and the enclosing of the phrase referring to the timing by commas indicate that the time that the court is seised was intended to refer to the holders of parental responsibility, in my opinion.  Page 22 \\x0c     70.   That  this  should  be  so  is  entirely  to  be  expected.  The  holders  of  parental responsibility may change from time to time. It is important that those who purport to  consent  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court  should  be  those  who  hold  that responsibility at a time when the court is seised of the proceedings. Self evidently, spouses do not need to be identified in any temporal dimension and the words, “at the time the court is seised” have no reference to them.   71. The  position  is  at  least  equally  clear  in  relation  to  article  12.3  (b).  Under this  provision  the  courts  of  a  Member  State  shall  have  jurisdiction  in  relation  to parental  responsibility  where  the  child  has  a  substantial  connection  with  that Member State and: -   “the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  has  been  accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the  parties  to  the  proceedings  at  the  time  the  court  is seised and is in the best interests of the child.”   If  it  had  been  intended  that  the  words,  “at  the  time  the  court  is  seised” 72. should refer to the timing of the acceptance of jurisdiction, it appears to me that the structure of the sentence best suited to achieve that result would be as follows: -   “the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  has  been  accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time  the  court  is  seised  by  all  the  parties  to  the proceedings and is in the best interests of the child.”   73. This interpretation would be, as Lord Collins suggests, sensible and would accord  with  the  spirit  of  the  Brussels  Convention,  the  Brussels  I  Regulation,  the Hague  Convention,  and  the  Brussels  II  Regulation.  It  also  avoids  the  spectre, identified by Professor Rauscher, of rendering article 12. 1 virtually ineffectual. I am afraid that I could not be sanguine about the workability of article 12.1 or 12.3 if the interpretation advanced by the respondent is accepted.   74.  Although I am reasonably firm in my opinion that the proper construction of these provisions is as Mr Setright submitted it should be, I agree with Lady Hale and  Lord  Collins  that  it  is  not  necessary  for  a  final  view  on  the  question  to  be reached  in  the  present  case.  This  is  so  because  it  is  clear  that  the  father  had unequivocally  accepted  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court  when,  in  2007,  it  was indisputably  seised  of  the  proceedings.  As  has  been  pointed  out,  moreover,  his  Page 23 \\x0c     subsequent  attitude  to  the  proceedings  evinced  unambiguous  acceptance  of  the court’s jurisdiction. LORD CLARKE   75.  I  agree  with  Lady  Hale  that  this  appeal  should  be  allowed  and  that  we  should make a declaration that the courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction in this case. I entirely agree with the reasoning and conclusions of Lady Hale and Lord Collins as to the meaning of “third State”, as to the use that can properly be made of post-seisin evidence to demonstrate unequivocal acceptance at the time of seisin, as to the father’s unequivocal acceptance  at  that  time  on  the  facts  and  as  to  the  best  interests  of  the  child.  Those conclusions are sufficient for this appeal to be decided by declaring that the English court has  jurisdiction.  The  only  point  which  has  caused  me  some  concern,  and  which  I  wish briefly  to  address  in  this  judgment,  is  the  true  construction  of  article  12.3(b)  of  the Brussels II Revised Regulation.   76.  Lord  Collins  has  considered  article  12.3(b)  in  some  detail.  I  entirely  agree  with paragraphs 47 to 58 of his analysis. I also agree with him that the questions whether the relevant acceptance of jurisdiction must be before the court is seised or whether it can be later  and,  if  so  when,  are  important  questions  and,  if  the  appeal  depended  upon  the answers, (subject to what I say below) may have to be referred to the European Court of Justice. It is perhaps for this reason that Lord Collins does not express a concluded view on  the  point.  As  stated  above,  I  agree  with  him  and  Lady  Hale  that  the  outcome  of  the appeal does not depend upon the answers to these questions.     77.  I  add  a  few  words  of  my  own  because  I  am  less  concerned  than  Lady  Hale  and Lord Collins about what I regard as the natural construction of article 12.3(b). Indeed it seems to me that there is much to be said for the conclusion that that construction is acte clair. As I see it, the natural construction of article 12.3(b) construed in its context and having regard to its provenance as set out by Lord Collins at paragraphs 57 and 58 is that the relevant acceptance of jurisdiction must be before the court is seised.   78. The question is what is meant by the expression “at the time the court is seised” in articles 12.1 and 12.3 of Brussels II Revised. For present purposes the relevant provision is article 12.3, which provides:   The  courts  of  a  Member  State  shall  also  have “3. jurisdiction in proceedings  other  than  those  referred  to  in  paragraph  1 where: to  parental  responsibility in  relation      Page 24 \\x0c     the  child  has  a  substantial  connection  with  that (a) member State, in particular by virtue of the fact that one of the  holders  of  parental  responsibility  is  habitually  resident in that Member  State or that the child  is  a  national of  that Member State and (b)  the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  has  been  accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seised and is in the best interests of the child.”  Article 12.1(b) is in very similar terms.   79. Until after Mr Setright QC had made his submissions, it had been contended by Mr Baker QC on behalf of the mother that the expression “the time the court is seised” in both  article  12.1  and  article  12.3  meant  the  specific  point  when  the  court  is  seised  as defined by article 16 of the Regulation. Mr Baker submitted that that construction was to be preferred to that of the Court of Appeal, which held, as Thorpe LJ put it at para 28, that the court was seised throughout the continuance of the proceedings.   80. Article 16 has been set out by Lady Hale. It identifies the time when “a court shall be  deemed  to  be  seised”.  It  is  plain  that  it  is  describing  a  particular  moment  and  not  a period of time. Thus in both (a) and (b) it provides for a particular moment when the court is seised, namely either when the document instituting the proceedings is lodged with the court or, if the document has to be served before being lodged with the court, when it is received  by  the  authority  responsible  for  service.  In  each  case  there  is  a  proviso  (or condition defeasant), namely that the applicant has not subsequently failed to take steps he was required to take, in the first case to have service effected on the respondent and in the  second  case  to  have  the  document  lodged  with  the  court.  As  Lady  Hale  says,  the importance  of  having  a  fixed  time  when  the  court  is  seised  is  explained  by  article  19 because,  if  the  court  first  seised  has  jurisdiction,  the  court  second  seised  must  decline jurisdiction. It is thus important to know in each case when the court is seised and which is the court first seised.   81.  Mr  Baker’s  submission  was  based  on  the  natural  construction  of  the  article construed  in  its  context,  which  includes  articles  16  and  19.  While  I  entirely  agree  with Lady  Hale  that  evidence  of  subsequent  events  may  (and  often  will)  assist  the  court  to decide what the position was at the moment identified as the time the court is deemed to be seised under article 16, I see nothing in the language of article 12.3 (or the equivalent language  of  article  12.1)  to  suggest  that,  if  the  court  was  not  seised  in  accordance  with article 16 at the time the document instituting the proceedings is lodged, it can somehow become seised at a later date. The only provision affecting the position as at the date of seisin is the proviso in article 16, which might defeat the seisin. However, subject to that,  Page 25 \\x0c     as I see it, there is no scope for later seisin. Once jurisdiction is acquired, the court has jurisdiction throughout the proceedings.     It  appears  to  me  that  in  principle  no-one  should  commence  proceedings  of  any 82. kind  unless  the  court  has  jurisdiction  or  will  have  it  at  the  moment  it  is  seised  of  the proceedings. Otherwise the court is being asked to exercise jurisdiction which it does not have. This is of particular importance in this context because, where the court first seised has jurisdiction, under article 19 a court second seised must decline jurisdiction, once it is established  that  the  court  first  seised  has  jurisdiction.  Article  16  makes  it  clear  that whether it has jurisdiction is to be tested as at the time of seisin as defined by article 16. Any other conclusion seems to me to be likely to lead to confusion.   Although Mr Setright submitted that in both article 12.1(b) and article 12.3(b) the 83. words  “at  the  time  the  court  is  seised”  identify  the  parties,  I  do  not  think  that  that  is  a convincing  reading  of  the  language.  It  is  much  more  natural  to  read  the  expression  as requiring the acceptance of jurisdiction at the time the court is seised. All the articles of the Regulation relate to the moment of seisin. This seems to me to be implicit in articles 3,  6  and  7  and  explicit  in  articles  8,  12,  13  and  14.  Moreover,  as  Lord  Collins demonstrates at paragraphs 57 and 58, the provenance of article 12 strongly supports this approach.  Thus  the  Commission  proposal  in  relation  to  what  became  article  12(3) provided that the courts of a Member State would have jurisdiction where “all holders of parental  responsibility  have  accepted  jurisdiction  at  the  time  the  court  is  seised”.  The Commission’s Practice Guide is to the same effect.  Although I quite understand that the point was not argued, it is I think of some note that this conclusion is consistent with a dictum  of  Lawrence  Collins  LJ  in  Bush  v  Bush  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  865,  [2008]  2  FLR 1437 at para 53. As he puts it paragraph 60 above, the paradigm case for acceptance of jurisdiction  would  be  actual  agreement  by  the  parents  at  the  time  proceedings  were instituted.     84. In  addition  it  seems  to  me  that  the  words  “has  been  accepted”  support  the  same approach.  Thus,  as  I  read  them,  both  article  12.1(b)  and  12.3(b)  require  that  “the jurisdiction of the courts has been accepted … at the time the court is seised” as defined in article 16. I respectfully disagree with Lady Hale at paragraph 27 that the expression ‘has  been  accepted’  is  more  consistent  with  the  possibility  of  later  acceptance  of jurisdiction. On the contrary, it seems to me to support the proposition that the acceptance must be before the seisin.   85. Various other solutions have been suggested. The Court of Appeal suggested that the parties can reach agreement at any time after  seisin.  This  might  be  months  or  years after  the  moment  identified  in  article  16.  I  do  not  see  how  such  an  approach  fits  with articles  16  and  19.  Mr  Setright’s  construction  does  not  seem  to  me  to  be  a  convincing reading  of  the  language.  Nor  to  my  mind  is that of Professor Rauscher quoted by  Lady Hale at paragraph 29. The expression “at the time the court is seised” appears not only in article  12  but  also  in  article  8,  where  it  surely  relates  to  the  time  the  court  is  seised  as defined in article 16, and does not mean “has been seised”.   Page 26 \\x0c     Further, if “is seised” means “has been seised”, it is not easy to see why the Court 86. of Appeal’s approach, namely that it means during the whole period of seisin, is wrong. The  problem  with  it  is  that  stated  above,  namely  that  it  does  not  readily  fit  in  with  the approach of the Regulation to the court first seised. Lady Hale suggests at paragraph 30 that article 16 fixes which proceedings are first in time for priority purposes but contains the possibility that apparent seisin may not mature into actual seisin unless the applicant effects service or lodges with the court. The suggestion is that a similar approach might be taken to prorogation so that the apparent seisin when the application is lodged does not mature into actual seisin until the respondent is served and has an opportunity to indicate whether or not he accepts jurisdiction. It is also suggested that that would be consistent with the English use of “has been” rather than “was”.   87. For my part, I find those suggestions difficult to accept. The Regulation could no doubt  have  so  provided  but  it  did  not.  As  I  see  it,  as  stated  above,  the  way  article  16 works is that there is seisin on the date identified subject to a condition defeasant. That is not  a  case  of  apparent  seisin  maturing  into  actual  seisin  but  there  being  actual  seisin, which  would  take  priority  over  any  subsequent  seisin,  unless  there  was  no  service  or lodgement. This would be known to the respondent immediately and the position would thus be clear immediately and, absent a failure of the kind expressly specified in article 16,  the  seisin  would  have  priority  over  seisin  in  another  jurisdiction  before  service  or lodgement.  I  do  not  see  how  this  can  readily  be  applied  to  article  12.1(b)  or  article 12.3(b). On the face of it the court would have no jurisdiction at the moment of seisin; yet the suggestion must I think involve the proposition that the court would have jurisdiction retrospectively if at some future moment the jurisdiction was unequivocally accepted. By then  another  court  might  be  seised  and  have  jurisdiction  as  the  court  first  seised.  Is  it really to be supposed that that other court would be required to decline jurisdiction under article 19 even though at the time it was seised no other court was seised? My answer to that question would be no.   88. I  appreciate  that  it  is  contemplated  that  the  respondent  would  take  a  stance immediately  and  that  the  position  would  be  much  as  occurs  (or  occurred)  under,  for example, article 23 of the Brussels Convention and article 24 of the Brussels I Regulation which are referred to by Lord Collins at paragraph 53. I also appreciate the force of the point that it is very odd for an unconditional appearance, which of course takes place after seisin,  to  be  a  ground  of  jurisdiction  in,  say,  the  Brussels  I  Regulation  and  not  in  the Brussels II Revised Regulation. However, in article 24 of Brussels I appearance is a free standing ground of jurisdiction, whereas there is no equivalent provision in the Brussels II Revised Regulation.         89. I  fully  understand  the  concerns  expressed  by  Lady  Hale  and  Lord  Collins  (and indeed Professor Rauscher) that article 12 will or may be of limited value if it does not extend to post seisin acceptance or agreement. However, it seems to me that the concerns are somewhat overstated. As I see it, the time for parties to decide in what jurisdiction to proceed  in  matters  relating  to  parental  responsibility  is  before  issuing  the  relevant proceedings. It is at that time that questions of jurisdiction should surely be considered, if only in order to decide where to issue the relevant process. It seems to me to be desirable that  parents  considering  proceedings  should  be  advised  that  that  is  the  time  to  make  an  Page 27 \\x0c     appropriate  agreement.  I  agree  with  Lord  Collins  that  that  is  the  paradigm  case  and  it seems to me that the problem should be tackled at the outset rather than that proceedings should  be  started  without  jurisdiction  in  the  hope  that  the  other  party  (or  parties)  will agree  later  or  do  something  which  could  be  construed  as  unequivocal  acceptance  of jurisdiction.     The  concerns  expressed  can  I  think  be  resolved  in  this  way.  If  an  express 90. agreement  to  jurisdiction  is  made  or  there  is  an  unequivocal  acceptance  of  jurisdiction after the court is seised and, by that time, proceedings have been commenced in a court in another  Member  State  and  that  court  has  become  seised,  article  19  will  operate  to  give exclusive  jurisdiction  to  that  second  court.  This  is  on  the  basis  that  at  the  time  the  first court  was  seised  it  did  not  have  jurisdiction  and  there  is  nothing  in  the  Regulation  to provide for retrospective seisin; so that for the purposes of the Regulation the court first seised  is  the  second  court.  The  parties’  legitimate  interests  are  however  protected  by article 15, which gives the court “having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter” a power to transfer all or part of the case to a court of another Member State if it concludes that such a court is in a Member State with which the child has a  particular  connection and that it would be better placed to hear the case or part of it.   91. If,  on  the  other  hand,  there  is  no  court  of  another  Member  State  that  has jurisdiction under the Regulation, I can at present see no reason why the applicant should not  issue  fresh  proceedings  and  rely  upon  the  agreement  or  unequivocal  acceptance  in those proceedings to satisfy article 12.3(b). In this way the court will have jurisdiction at the time of seisin, which to my mind is what the Regulation intended. As I see it, in this way the concerns expressed by the Court of Appeal, Lady Hale, Lord Collins and others can be allayed. In particular in a case of this kind, where there is no other Member State which  could  have  jurisdiction,  the  court  in  which  the  respondent  has  unequivocally accepted jurisdiction will have jurisdiction, albeit in proceedings commenced thereafter.   92. I  appreciate  that  these  are  all  questions  for  decision  in  another  case.  I  express provisional views upon them in the hope that they may help to resolve potential issues in the future without the delay inevitably involved in a reference to the European Court of Justice. In the meantime, I agree that the appeal in this case should be allowed.  Page 28'}, 'press summary': {'Press summary': 'I (A Child) [2009] UKSC 10 [On appeal from [2009] EWCA Civ 965]', 'Justices': 'Lord Hope (Deputy President), Lady Hale, Lord Collins, Lord Kerr, Lord Clarke', 'Background to the appeal': 'This appeal concerns whether an English court has jurisdiction to determine the future level of contact between a child and his mother where the child does not habitually reside in an EU Member State. Under article 12.3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (“Brussels II Revised”) parties are able to opt in to the jurisdiction of an EU court which would not otherwise have jurisdiction to determine a child’s future. This applies where: (a)  the child has a substantial connection with that Member State; and (b)  the jurisdiction of the courts “has been expressly accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seised”, and the exercise of jurisdiction is in the best interests of the child. In this case the child had been resident in Pakistan since 2004, although both he and his divorced parents are British citizens and his parents live here. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal held that an English court had no jurisdiction. The mother appealed. The Supreme Court had two issues to decide: firstly, whether article 12 extended to cases where a child lived in a non-EU member state; and secondly, if it did, whether the parties in this case had accepted jurisdiction in accordance with the criteria set out in article 12.3(b).', 'Judgment': 'The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and declares that the courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction in this case. The Supreme Court holds that article 12 of Brussels II Revised applies to a child who is lawfully resident outside the European Union. In this case it was clear that the criteria of article 12.3 were satisfied and therefore that the parties had opted in to this jurisdiction. Lady Hale gave the leading judgment. There was a difference of opinion between the Justices on the precise meaning of article 12.3(b) but it was not necessary to decide this issue in order to decide the case.(Paragraphs [17], [35], [45])', 'Reasons for the judgment': '\\uf0b7  On the first issue, if parents opt in to the jurisdiction of an EU court under article 12.3, that court can exercise jurisdiction even if the child does not lawfully reside within the territory of a an EU Member State. Lady Hale reached this conclusion using ordinary principles of construction, concluding that nothing in article 12 limits jurisdiction to children who reside in an EU Member State. This was confirmed by the conclusion that the term “third State” in other parts of the Regulation (notably articles 12.4 and 61) means a state outside the EU. This is supported by the Practice Guide to the Regulation, as well as other sources emanating from the EU.

In any event such an agreement between judges could not affect the proper interpretation of Brussels II Revised. [41]-[44]  \\uf0b7  On the second issue, the criteria under article 12.3 were clearly satisfied in this case. Firstly, under 12.3(a), the substantial connection was satisfied by the fact the child’s parents are habitually resident in the UK and they and the child are British citizens. [21] Secondly, jurisdiction had been expressly and unequivocally accepted by the parties under 12.3(b), both before and after proceedings commenced. In particular, the father had accepted jurisdiction by undertaking to bring the child back here if required to do so by the Court. [33]-[34] Finally, the exercise of jurisdiction was in the best interests of the child given the presumption in article 12.4 that where a child is resident in certain non-EU States it will be in his best interests for jurisdiction to be exercised under this article. It was also relevant that the child’s guardian in the High Court considered that the child’s future was best decided in this country. [37]-[38]  \\uf0b7  The Justices expressed different views on the meaning of the words in article 12.3(b) requiring express or unequivocal acceptance by all of the parties to the proceedings “at the time the court is seised”. Did this mean before, when or after the relevant proceedings were begun? It was also unclear whether these words describe the time at which parties have accepted jurisdiction or, as argued on behalf of the interveners Reunite, describe the parties whose acceptance is required. The Justices do not express a concluded view as it was not necessary to do so in order to decide this appeal. In this case all the parties had given unequivocal acceptance both before and after the proceedings had begun. The diversity of views indicates that the interpretation is not acte clair and if a case arises where the issue has to be decided it may have to be the subject of a reference to the European Court of Justice under articles 68 and 234 of the EC Treaty.

This is a judgment of the Court.   2. This appeal requires a revisiting of a vexed but highly important topic. The significance of parenthood in private law disputes about residence and contact has exercised many courts over many years but one might have thought that the final word  on  the  subject  had  been  uttered  in  the  comprehensive  and  authoritative opinion of Baroness Hale of Richmond in In re G (Children) (Residence: Same-sex Partner) [2006] UKHL 43, [2006] 1 WLR 2305. As this case illustrates, however, misunderstandings  about  the  true  import  of  that  decision  and  the  applicable principles persist. 3. The case concerns a young boy whom we will call Harry, although that is not  his  real  name.  Harry  will  be  four  years  old  in  December  of  this  year.  Until recently, apart from at weekends, he has lived continuously with the appellant, GB, who is his maternal grandmother. On 6 March 2009 Lowestoft Family Proceedings Court  made  a  residence  order  in  favour  of  GB.  A  contact  order  allowing  staying contact  with  both  parents  was  also  made.  The  orders  of  the  Family  Proceedings Court  were  appealed  by  Harry’s  father  RJB  to  the  Family  Division.  His  Honour Judge  Richards,  sitting  as  a  High  Court  Judge, heard the appeal on 3 April 2009 and he made an order which, among other things, directed that there should be a transfer of residence to the father on 25 April.  4. GB appealed Judge Richards’ order and her appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal (Wall and Elias LJJ) on 21 May 2009. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court dismissed the appeal and stated that the reasons for dismissal would be given later. Permission to appeal to the House of Lords was refused. The reasons for  dismissing  the  appeal  were  provided  in  a  judgment  handed  down  on  11  June 2009. A stay on the transfer of residence was granted on that date to allow GB to petition  the  House  of  Lords  for  permission  to  appeal.  It  was  a  condition  of  the grant  of  the  stay,  however,  that  Harry  should  have  contact  with  his  father  from Thursday  afternoon  until  4  pm  on  Monday  each  week.  That  level  of  contact continued  until  the  hearing  of  the  appeal  before  this  court.  Permission  to  appeal was granted on 30 July 2009  and  the  appeal  was  heard  on 14 October. Both GB and  RJB  were  represented  on  the  appeal.  Harry’s  mother,  GLB,  appeared  on  her own behalf and her only – albeit important – submission to this court was to the effect  that  she  wanted  the  best  for  her  son.  When  the  hearing  ended,  this  court  Page 2 \\x0c           announced that the appeal would be allowed for reasons that we would provide at a later date. This judgment contains those reasons. Family Background 5. Harry’s parents met in the autumn of 2004. They separated in April 2005, eight  months  before  Harry  was  born.  GB  has  been  principally  responsible  for caring  for  him  from  the  time  of  his  birth.  Indeed,  she  was  present  when  he  was born  and  immediately  afterwards  he  went  to  live  in  her  home.  Until  the  order  of the  Court  of  Appeal  giving  extended  contact  to  his  father,  Harry  has  lived  there ever since.  6. Neither of Harry’s parents was able to care for him satisfactorily in the first years of his life. His mother, GLB, lived with her mother and Harry intermittently at GB’s home from the time that he was born until July 2006. She left GB’s home then and has not returned. 7. On 9 November 2006 GB was granted a residence order. This was made on consent.  At  the  same  time  a  parental  responsibility  order  was  made  in  favour  of Harry’s father, RJB. This also appears to have been made on consent. Thereafter he spent a night and a day of every weekend with each of his parents in turn.  8. In  July  2007,  Harry’s  father  was  convicted  of  racially  aggravated  assault. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. It is not clear whether this term was twelve or eighteen months but that is not important in relation to the issues which arise on the appeal.  While in prison RJB met SB, the sister of another inmate. On his release in March 2008 they formed a relationship and they married some time later. On 11 February 2009 their daughter was born. SB also has an older daughter of  about  the  same  age  as  Harry  from  an  earlier  relationship.  The  older  daughter lives with RJB, SB and the daughter born in February 2009. RJB has a much older son  from  another  relationship  but  there  is  no  contact  between  this  son  and  his father.  9. GB  has  not  been  without  difficulties  in  her  personal  life.  Tests  have revealed that she has had a high alcohol consumption level in the past. She has a conviction for driving with excess alcohol and she has been the victim of domestic  Page 3 \\x0c          violence.  Some  episodes  of  this  violence  occurred  in  Harry’s  presence  but  the person who was responsible for them no longer lives with GB.  The Family Proceedings Court Hearing 10.  On 28 May 2008 Harry’s mother applied for a residence order. In the course of the proceedings which followed, Harry’s father made his own application for a residence  order.  Despite  having  applied  herself  for  a  residence  order,  Harry’s mother  supported  the  father’s  application.  The  order  of  9  November  2006  in favour of GB was, of course, still in force at this time and she made plain her wish to continue to care for Harry.  11.  A  report  from  a  social  care  manager  of  the  local  authority,  AW,  was prepared for the hearing pursuant to section 7 of the Children Act 1989.  It is dated 4  January  2009.    It  is  not  clear  whether  AW  spoke  to  SB,  the  wife  of  Harry’s father, but he certainly spoke to Harry’s grandmother and to both his parents. AW considered  that  Harry  was  thriving  in  the  care  of  his  grandmother.  He  enjoyed contact  with  other  family  members,  however,  and  had  developed  positive relationships  with  them.  AW  concluded  that  Harry’s  mother  was  not  capable  of providing  a  safe  and  stable  environment  for  Harry.  While  there  were  some concerns about GB, AW reached the view that she had proved capable of meeting Harry’s needs.  In relation to Harry’s father, AW said this:   “In  my  opinion,  there  is  very  little  in  [RJB’s] commitment,  motivation  and  capabilities  to  indicate that  he  could  not  meet  [Harry’s]  needs.  He  is  in  a secure relationship and can provide stability to his son. He and his wife possess the necessary knowledge and skills to raise a child healthily. Their situation with the birth of their child places them in  an  untested  situation  that  only  a  period  of  time would resolve.” 12.  AW  considered  that  to  transfer  Harry’s  residence  to  his  mother  or  father would  have  “a  significant  impact”  on  him.  In  his  view,  the  stability  and  security that  Harry  enjoyed  was  due  to  the  consistency  and  predictability  of  his grandmother’s care. He had begun to form his first significant peer relationships at  Page 4 \\x0c          nursery  and  a  move  away  from  this  would be disruptive for him.  AW  concluded therefore  that,  while  Harry’s  placement  with  GB  was  not  perfect,  on  balance  it should continue.   13.  A  sentence  in  the  conclusion  section  of  AW’s  report  has  proved  to  be somewhat controversial in the case. It was to this effect:  “In  my  opinion  there  needs  (sic)  to  be  compelling reasons to disrupt [Harry’s] continuity of care and the consistency  and  predictability  that  accompanies  (sic) it.”   14. The  justices  used  the  same  formulation  in  the  pro  forma  document  that recorded the reasons for their decision. Incongruously, however, this appeared as the final paragraph in the section of the form that recorded findings of fact. It read:   “We  have  not  found  compelling  reasons  to  disrupt [Harry’s]  continuity  of  care  and  the  consistency  and predictability that accompanies (sic) it.” 15. Plainly,  this  was  a  verbatim  quotation  from  AW’s  report.  It  has  been suggested  that  the  justices  fell  into  error  in  stating  that  they  required  compelling reasons  to  remove  Harry  from  his  grandmother’s  care.  We  do  not  accept  that suggestion. In the first place, the justices did not say that they required compelling reasons – merely that they did not find such reasons.  More importantly, taken as a whole, the pro forma that the justices prepared points unmistakably to their having conducted a careful weighing of the various factors that bore directly on what was in Harry’s best interests. Thus, for instance, they reviewed his development while in the care of GB; noted that she had facilitated contact with both Harry’s parents, even  when  his  father  was  in  prison;  noted  the  risk  of  harm  if  he  was  moved; recorded that he had good relationships with both parents and his grandmother, all of whom were significant in his life; and expressly stated that they had balanced all interests in making their decision and had treated Harry’s welfare as paramount. 16.  We are satisfied, therefore, that the justices did not consider that compelling reasons  were  an  essential  prerequisite  to  any  alteration  of  the  status  quo.  It  is perhaps  unfortunate  that  the  social  care  manager  made  the  ‘compelling  reasons’ reference  and  unfortunate  too  that  it  was  incorporated  by  the  justices  in  their  Page 5 \\x0c          statement of reasons but one should guard against an overly fastidious approach in parsing  the  contents  of  such  statements.  Isolated  from  its  context,  the  phrase  is redolent  of  an  over-emphasis  on  the  importance  of  continuing  what  had  gone before but we have concluded that, on a fair reading of the entire statement, it can be confidently said that this did not happen. The decision of Judge Richards 17. In para 21 of his judgment, Judge Richards acknowledged that the justices had taken all the evidence into account and that their recorded reasons betokened a very careful weighing of that evidence. He concluded, however, that they had been “distracted  by  their  consideration  of  the  settled  way  in  which  [Harry]  has  been brought up.”  (para 29) 18. The judge referred to the decision of In re G, (which had received a passing reference  in  the  justices’  statement  of  reasons  that  we  will  consider  later  in  this judgment).  He  suggested,  at  para  23,  that  the  House  of  Lords  had  made  clear  in that case that “in the ordinary way … the rearing of a child by his or her biological parents  can  be  expected  to  be  in  the  child’s  best  interests,  both  in  the  short  term and,  more  importantly,  in  the  longer  term”.  For  reasons  that  we  shall  give presently, we do not consider that this is a proper representation of the decision in In re G and we believe that it was the failure to properly understand the burden of the decision in that case that led the judge into error. 19. The theme that it was preferable for children to be raised by their biological parent or parents was developed by the judge in paras 24 and 25 of his judgment.  He stated that it was the right of the child to be brought up in the home of his or her natural parent. (It is clear from the context that the judge was using the term ‘natural  parent’  to  mean  ‘biological  parent’.)  We  consider  that  this  statement betrays  a  failure  on  the  part  of  the  judge  to  concentrate  on  the  factor  of overwhelming – indeed, paramount – importance which is, of course, the welfare of  the  child.  To  talk  in  terms  of  a  child’s  rights  –  as  opposed  to  his  or  her  best interests  –  diverts  from  the  focus  that  the  child’s  welfare  should  occupy  in  the minds of those called on to make decisions as to their residence. 20. The distraction that discussion of rights rather than welfare can occasion is well illustrated in the latter part of Judge Richards’ judgment. In paras 28 and 30 he  suggested  that,  provided  the  parenting  that  Harry’s  father  could  provide  was  Page 6 \\x0c          “good  enough”,  it  was  of  no  consequence  that that which the grandmother could provide would be better. We consider that in decisions about residence such as are involved  in  this  case;  there  is  no  place  for  the  question  whether  the  proposed placement would be “good enough”. The court’s quest is to determine what is in the  best  interests  of  the  child,  not  what  might  constitute  a  second  best  but supposedly adequate alternative. As the Court of Appeal pointed out at para 61, the concept  of  ‘good  enough’  parenting  has  always  been  advanced  in  the  context  of public law proceedings and of care within the wider family as opposed to care by strangers. 21. Judge Richards acknowledged that he could only reverse the decision of the justices  if  he  came  to  the  conclusion  that they were plainly wrong.  He  explained his reasons for coming to that conclusion in the following passage from para 29:  this  was  plainly  wrong, “…  I have come to the view, applying as I do the test of  whether in circumstances where it is clear that the father can meet this  child’s  needs  that  he  would  have  a  settled  and established home with his own family, that the justices were plainly wrong in coming to their conclusion that [Harry] should remain with his grandmother.” that 22.  After  the  judge  had  delivered  his  judgment,  counsel  on  behalf  of  Harry’s grandmother applied for leave to appeal. She submitted that the judge had attached undue  importance  to  what  he  perceived  to  be  the  desirability  of  Harry  being brought up by his biological parent and that he had been thereby distracted from concentrating on Harry’s welfare. The judge rejected that submission, stating:   “For  my  part,  I  hope  I  made  it  clear  that  [Harry’s] welfare  is,  and  remains,  the  paramount  consideration.  The  test  that  the  justices  should  have  applied  was  the welfare test.  That is the test that I apply as well.” 23. In fact, at no point in his judgment did the judge say that Harry’s welfare was the paramount consideration. We do not suggest that this statement requires to be intoned like a mantra on every occasion that a judgment on the residence of a child  is  given.  Often  it  will  be  clear  from  the  approach  of  the  judge  that  this fundamental  consideration  underlay  his  or  her  reasoning.  In  the  present  case,  Page 7 \\x0c          however, we are satisfied that the judge, notwithstanding what he said in refusing leave to appeal, did not afford Harry’s welfare the dominant position that it should have occupied in the decision as to his residence. Instead, he allowed the question of  the  child’s  so-called  right  to  be  raised  by  his  biological  parent  to  influence  – indeed to define – the outcome of the residence debate. The judgment of the Court of Appeal 24. The Court of Appeal concluded at para 24 that the justices had made what were described as “two important errors of law”. The first of these related to their treatment of In re G.  At para 14 of the section in the justices’ statement of reasons entitled ‘findings of fact’ the following appeared: - “In re G (Residence: Same-sex Partner) [2005] EWCA Civ  462,  [2005]  2  FLR  states  a  child  should  not  be removed  from  primary  care  of  biological  parents.  [Harry]  has  never father.  Grandmother has been his psychological parent.” resided  with  his 25.  Wall LJ, who delivered the judgment of the court, observed at para 23 that it  was  unfortunate  that  the  justices  had  referred  to  the  decision  of  the  Court  of Appeal in In re G since that had been reversed by the House of Lords. In fairness to  the  justices,  the  incorrect  citation  appears  to  have  derived  from  the  skeleton argument of counsel for the father. In any event, it is clear from the reference in para 14 that the justices had considered (to the extent that they had considered it at all) the decision of the House of Lords rather than that of the Court of Appeal. In her skeleton argument, counsel for RJB had quoted the virtual entirety of the short speech  of  Lord  Nicholls  of  Birkenhead.  It  would  appear  that  this  provided  the source material for the justices’ statement that a child should not be removed from the primary care of biological parents.   26.  Despite the fact that Baroness Hale had delivered the leading opinion in In re G and that all the other members of the appellate committee had expressed their unqualified agreement with it, her speech does not appear to have been extensively considered – indeed a single sentence of her opinion was all that was quoted in the skeleton  argument  submitted  on  behalf  of  the  father.    It  was  to  the  effect  that “parenthood is to be regarded as an important and significant factor in considering which proposals advance the welfare of the child” ([2009] 1 WLR 2305, para 31).  Page 8 \\x0c         As we shall see, the significance of Baroness Hale’s speech to the outcome of this case went far beyond this somewhat selective quotation. 27. In  developing  its  first  criticism  of  the  justices’  approach  the  Court  of Appeal suggested that there had not been a sufficient discussion of the respective roles  of  parents  and  grandparents  in  a  child’s  life.  As  a  consequence,  the  court concluded that the justices had fallen into error in referring to the grandmother as Harry’s psychological parent while failing to acknowledge his father’s role beyond recording that he was capable of meeting Harry’s needs. 28.  When considering the criticism that the justices had failed to – in the words of  Wall  LJ  at  para  24  –  “grapple  adequately  with  the  fundamental  issue  in  the case” - one must keep closely in mind that the context in which discussion of the respective roles of the father and the grandmother in Harry’s life should take place is how those roles and the manner in which the parent and grandparent fulfil them can  conduce  to  the  child’s  welfare.  Whether  this  particular  criticism  is  justified depends, therefore, on the sufficiency of the justices’ consideration of the roles of the  father  and  grandmother  in  terms  of  the  contribution  that  they  could  make  to Harry’s welfare. 29. The  pro  forma  document  that  the  justices  prepared  giving  the  reasons  for their decision should not, we believe, be treated as containing an exhaustive record of  all  the  material  that  was  considered  by  them.  From  the  note  of  the  evidence given in the family proceedings court it is clear that the role that the father could play  in  Harry’s  life  and  the  care  that  he  had  provided  in  the  past  were comprehensively canvassed and debated. Both GB and AW were cross examined extensively about these issues and it is difficult to accept that the justices did not have them in mind in making the decision about residence. 30. It would perhaps have been preferable if the justices had placed on record that they had considered the role of his father in Harry’s life but it is not easy to see  what  they  might  have  said  beyond  that.  They  had  commented  that  RJB  had helped  with  Harry’s  care  in  the  past  and  had  expressed  himself  willing  to  do  so again; they acknowledged that he was capable of meeting Harry’s needs; and they accepted that Harry had enjoyed a good relationship with his father. It is clear that they were alert to the role that he had played in this young boy’s life. We cannot therefore  agree  that  they  failed  to  grapple  with  the  respective  roles  of  father  and grandmother.  Page 9 \\x0c        31. The second “important error of law” identified by the Court of Appeal was the justices’ statement in relation to compelling reasons.  Wall LJ said this about that statement:  to reasons remove  H  “25. … in our judgment, it was clearly an error of law for  the  justices  to  say,  as  they  did,  that  it  required compelling from  his grandmother's  care.  Whilst  they  make  it  clear  that [Harry's]  welfare  was  their  paramount  consideration, the question which they had to decide was whether or not  it  was  in  [Harry's]  interests  in  both  the  short  and the long term to live with his grandmother or his father. The introduction of 'compelling reasons' clearly means, we think, that the justices gave too much weight to the 'status  quo'  argument,  and  too  little  to  the  role  of  his father in [Harry's] life and care. Indeed, they appear to have  created  a  presumption  that  the  status  quo  should prevail  unless  there  are  compelling  arguments  to  the contrary.” 32.  As  we  have  pointed  out  at  [14]  above,  the  justices  did  not  say  that  they required such reasons, merely that they had not found them. When one examines the statement of reasons as a whole and has in mind that this was a direct quotation from AW’s report, it is not difficult to reach the conclusion that the justices did not regard this as an essential pre-condition to Harry’s residence being transferred to his father. We find it impossible to agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that  this  statement  betokened  an  over  emphasis  by  the  justices  on  preserving  the status quo. In re G 33. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that In re G had given the final quietus to the notion that parental rights have any part to play in the assessment of where the best interests of a child lay. Indeed, (correctly in our view) it identified this as the  principal  message  provided  by  the  case.  It  is  certainly  the  principal  message that was pertinent to the present case. It appears, however, that the urgency of that message has been blunted somewhat by reference to the speech of Lord Nicholls and some misunderstanding of the opinion that he expressed.  Having agreed that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons to be given by Baroness Hale, Lord Nicholls said at para 2:   Page 10 \\x0c           “The  present  unhappy  dispute the children's  mother  and  her  former  partner  Ms  CW.    In this  case,  as  in  all  cases  concerning  the  upbringing  of children, the court seeks to identify the course which is in the best interests of the children.” is  between He then said:   “Their welfare is the court's paramount consideration.  In reaching its decision the court should always have in mind that in the ordinary way the rearing of a child by his or her biological parent can be expected to be in the child's  best  interests,  both  in  the  short  term  and  also, and  importantly,  in  the  longer  term.  I  decry  any tendency to diminish the significance of this factor. A child should not be removed from the primary care of his  or  her  biological  parents  without  compelling reason.  Where  such  a  reason  exists  the  judge  should spell this out explicitly.” 34.  As  we  have  observed,  it  appears  to  have  been  in  reliance  on  the  latter passage that the justices stated that a child should not be removed from the primary care  of  biological  parents.  A  careful  reading  of  what  Lord  Nicholls  actually  said reveals, of course, that he did not propound any general rule to that effect. For a proper understanding of the view that he expressed, it is important at the outset to recognise that Lord Nicholls’ comment about the rearing of a child by a biological parent is set firmly in the context of the child’s welfare. This he identified as “the court's  paramount  consideration”.  It  must  be  the  dominant  and  overriding  factor that ultimately determines disputes about residence and contact and there can be no dilution of its importance by reference to extraneous matters. 35.  When Lord Nicholls said that courts should keep in mind that the interests of  a  child  will  normally  be  best  served  by  being  reared  by  his  or  her  biological parent, he was doing no more than reflecting common experience that, in general, children tend to thrive when brought up by parents to whom they have been born. He  was  careful  to  qualify  his  statement,  however,  by  the  words  “in  the  ordinary way the rearing of a child by his or her biological parent can be expected to be in the  child's  best  interests”  (emphasis  added).  In  the  ordinary  way  one  can  expect  Page 11 \\x0c       that  children  will  do  best  with  their  biological  parents.  But  many  disputes  about residence  and  contact  do  not  follow  the  ordinary  way.  Therefore,  although  one should keep in mind the common experience to which Lord Nicholls was referring, one must not be slow to recognise those cases where that common experience does not provide a reliable guide. 36.  Although  the  factual  background  to  the  case  of  In  re  G  was,  as  Baroness Hale  described  it,  ‘novel’  (a  lesbian  couple  decided  to  have  children  together, arranged for anonymous donor insemination and brought up the children together until their relationship broke down) the issues arising and the legal principles that applied  were,  as  Baroness  Hale  pointed  out,  just  the  same  as  would  arise  in  the case of a heterosexual couple. After conducting what the Court of Appeal rightly described as a scholarly analysis of the statute and the authorities which pre-dated the 1989 Act, Baroness Hale turned to consider the recommendations of the Law Commission report on private law cases relating to child care.  She said this at para 30:  and law care “[30]  My  Lords,  the  [Children  Act  1989]  brought together  the  Government's  proposals  in  relation  to child the  Law  Commission's recommendations  in  relation  to  the  private  law.  In  its Working  Paper  No  96,  Family  Law:  Review  of  Child Law:  Custody  (1986),  at  para  6.22,  having  discussed whether there should be some form of presumption in favour of natural parents, the Law Commission said:  ‘We  conclude,  therefore,  that  the  welfare  of each  child  in  the  family  should  continue  to  be the  paramount  consideration  whenever  their custody  or  upbringing  is  in  question  between private  individuals.  The  welfare  test  itself  is well able to encompass any special contribution which natural parents can make to the emotional needs of their child, in particular to his sense of identity  and  self-esteem,  as  well  as  the  added their commitment  which  knowledge  of parenthood  may  bring.  We  have  already  said that the indications are that the priority given to the welfare of the child needs to be strengthened than  undermined.  We  could  not rather recommendation contemplate  making any  Page 12 \\x0c       which  might  have  the  effect  of  weakening  the protection  given  to  children  under  the  present law.’    Nor  should  we.  The  statutory  position  is  plain:  the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. As Lord  MacDermott  explained  in J  v  C  [1070]  AC  668, 711,  this  means  that  it  ‘rules  upon  or  determines  the course  to  be  followed’.  There  is  no  question  of  a parental right. As the Law Commission explained: ‘the welfare test itself is well able to encompass any  special  contribution  which  natural  parents can make to the emotional needs of their child’ or,  as  Lord  MacDermott  put  it,  the  claims  and  wishes of  parents  ‘can  be  capable  of  ministering  to  the  total welfare of the child in a special way’.” 37. This passage captures the central point of the In re G case and of this case.  It  is  a  message  which  should  not  require  reaffirmation  but,  if  and  in  so  far  as  it does,  we  would  wish  to  provide  it  in  this  judgment.  All  consideration  of  the importance of parenthood in private law disputes about residence must be firmly rooted  in  an  examination  of  what  is  in  the  child’s  best  interests.  This  is  the paramount  consideration.  It  is  only  as  a  contributor  to  the  child’s  welfare  that parenthood assumes any significance. In common with all other factors bearing on what  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  child,  it  must  be  examined  for  its  potential  to fulfil that aim.  There are various ways in which it may do so, some of which were explored by Baroness Hale in In re G, but the essential task for the court is always the same. 38. For the reasons that we have given, we consider that the justices’ decision cannot be characterised as ‘plainly wrong’. True it is that they misapprehended the real import of In re G and it was, as we have said, unfortunate that they repeated the  phrase  ‘compelling  reasons’  from  AW’s  report  but  we  do  not  consider  that these  detract  from  their  careful  evaluation  of  the  evidence  and  their  weighing  of the  various  competing  factors  involved  in  their  determination  of  the  question  of  Page 13 \\x0c         Harry’s  residence.  Nor  do  they  detract  from  their  important  recognition  that  his welfare was the paramount consideration in that determination. 39. It  follows  that  Judge  Richards  erred  in  his  conclusion  that  it  was  open  to him to reverse the justices’ findings. The judge was correct in his view that G v G [1985] 1 WLR 647 forbade interference with the exercise of the justices’ discretion unless  the  decision  was  plainly  wrong.  Where  he  fell  into  error  was  in  deciding that his analysis of their statement of reasons supported his conclusion that it was so. law  cases to  private law  proceedings  under 40. The  Court  of  Appeal  recognised  some  of  the  deficiencies  in  the  judge’s analysis,  in  particular  his  apparent  application  of  the  principles  relevant  only  in public the  1989  Act;  his pronouncement  of  something  which  came  close  to  a  presumption  that  a  child should  live  with  his  biological  parent  or  parents;  and  of  the  relevance  of  the concept  of  ‘good  enough’  parenting  in  this  case.  But  the  court  considered  that  it could  overlook  these  shortcomings  because  “the  judge’s  fundamental  [approach] was not plainly wrong” (para 62). This in turn depended on their acceptance of the judge’s  conclusion  that  the  justices’  decision  was  plainly  wrong.  Since  we  have concluded  that  it  was  not,  the  basis  on  which  the  Court  of  Appeal  felt  able  to uphold Judge Richards’ decision falls away. 41.  As we have said earlier, many disputes about residence and contact do not follow the ordinary way. This case is one such. Harry has lived virtually all of his young life with his grandmother. He has naturally formed a strong bond with her. There is reason to apprehend that, if that bond is broken, his current stability will be  threatened.  Harry’s  father  had  undergone  significant  changes  in  his  own domestic arrangements at the time that the justices made their decision. While he was  assessed  as  capable  of  meeting  Harry’s  needs,  those  arrangements  remained untested at the time the justices had to determine where Harry should live. There was  therefore  ample  material  available  to  the  justices  to  reach  the  determination they did. That determination lay comfortably within the range of the decisions that the  justices,  in  the  exercise  of  their  discretion,  could  reasonably  make.  For  these reasons we allowed the appeal. 42.  What we heard of the contact and residence arrangements made as  a result of  the  conditions  imposed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  order  granting  a  stay confirmed  the  view  that  considerable  disruption  to  Harry’s  life  would  have  been involved in a transfer to live with his father. The distance between the homes of his  Page 14 \\x0c      grandmother and his father exceeds thirty miles, we were told. It seems inevitable that,  if  he  were  to  live  with  his  father,  he  would  no  longer  be  able  to  attend  the nursery where he has already made good progress. Transfer of his residence would involve a great deal more than a change of address.  Many of the familiar aspects of his life which anchor his stability and sense of security would be changed. The justices  were  therefore  right  to  give  significant  weight  to  the  desirability  of preserving  the  status  quo.  This  is  a  factor  which  will  not  always  command  the importance that must be attached to it in the present case but we are satisfied that it was of considerable significance in the debate as to where this child’s best interests lay. 43. For  that  reason,  it  is  perhaps  regrettable  that  such  a  radical  change  to Harry’s  residence  and  contact  arrangements  came  about  as  a  result  of  the conditions  imposed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal.    Conscious  of  the  need  to  minimise the sense of bewilderment that can accompany abrupt and substantial changes to a child’s  living  arrangements,  we  made  a  transitional  order  that  provided  for  a phased  return  to  those  that  were  in  place  before.  We  consider  that,  as  a  general rule, conditions such as were imposed by the Court of Appeal in this case should not  be  made  where  a  party  seeks  permission  to  appeal,  not  least  because  these might be seen as an unwarranted disincentive to the pursuit of what proved in this case to be a fully merited application.  Page 15\"}, 'press summary': {'Press summary': '', 'Justices': 'Lord Hope (Deputy President), Lady Hale, Lord Collins, Lord Kerr and Lord Clarke', 'Background to the appeal': 'H is a three year old child whose parents separated before his birth.  From the date of his birth until very  recently,  H  has  lived  with  his  maternal  grandmother,  GB.    H’s  mother,  GLB,  lived  with  her mother and H intermittently at GB’s home from the time he was born until July 2006.  She left GB’s home then and has not returned.  In  November  2006,  GB  was  granted,  by  consent,  a  residence  order  in  respect  of  H.    On  the  same occasion orders for contact were made in favour of H’s father, RJB.    In May 2008, RJB applied for a residence order in respect of H.  By the time the application was heard in the Family Proceedings Court in March 2009, RJB had married and his new wife was expecting their child.  RJB’s application, which was supported by H’s mother, was refused.  In making their decision, the justices noted that they had not found compelling reasons to disrupt the continuity of care that GB provided H.   RJB appealed the justices’ decision.  That appeal was successful in the High Court, the judge finding that the justices had been plainly wrong in making the residence order in favour of GB, having been distracted by the settled way in which H had been brought up by GB.  In April 2009, the High Court made an order that H should reside with RJB.    The  order  of  the  High  Court  was  appealed  by  GB  in  the  Court  of  Appeal.    The  Court  of  Appeal dismissed the appeal holding that in giving disproportionate weight to the status quo the justices had made an error of law sufficient to entitle the circuit judge to overrule their decision.  Applying Re G (Children) (Residence: Same Sex Partner) [2006] 1 WLR 2305, and in particular the observations in that case of Lord Nicholls, the Court of Appeal held that although a child’s welfare was the court’s paramount consideration,  the  court  should  always  bear  in  mind  that,  ordinarily,  the  rearing  of  a  child  by  his biological parent could be expected to be in his best interests.', 'Judgment': 'The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal by GB.  In doing so, it reaffirmed the central message in Re G that, where in a case between private individuals a child’s custody or upbringing is in question, the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. The judgment delivered by Lord Kerr was the judgment of the court to which all of its members contributed.

(Paragraphs [18]-[19], [32]-[37]) \\uf0b7  The justices’ decision was not “plainly wrong”.  They had recognised that H’s welfare was the paramount  consideration  and  had  carefully  evaluated  the  evidence  before  them,  correctly weighing up the various competing factors.  For this reason, both the judge and the Court of Appeal had erred in overturning the justices’ decision. (Paragraphs [9]-[15], [37]-[39]) \\uf0b7  Both  the  judge  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  misinterpreted  Re  G.    When,  in  that  case,  Lord Nicholls said that courts should keep in mind that the interests of a child will normally be best served by being reared by his or her biological parent, he was doing no more than reflecting common  experience  that,  in  general,  children  tend  to  thrive  when  brought  up  by  parents  to whom they have been born.  All consideration of the importance of parenthood in private law disputes about residence must be firmly rooted in an examination of what is in the child’s best interests.  This is the paramount consideration.  It is only as a contributor to the child’s welfare that parenthood assumes any significance.  In common with all other factors bearing on what is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  child,  it  must  be  examined  for  its  potential  to  fulfil  that  aim. (Paragraphs [1], [17], [23]-[25], [32]-[37])  Any discussion of a child’s right to be brought up by its natural parents is misplaced.  The only consideration for the court is the child’s welfare; to talk of a child’s rights detracts from that consideration. (Paragraphs [18]-[19])   In  this  case,  there  was  reason  to  believe  that  if  H’s  bond  with  GB  were  broken  his  current stability  would  be  threatened.    Whilst  RJB  was  assessed  as  capable  of  meeting  H’s  needs,  he had recently undergone significant changes in his own domestic position and his arrangements were untested at the time the justices made their decision.  In deciding where H’s best interests lay the justices were therefore right to give significant weight to maintaining the status quo in H’s living arrangements.

But  they  may  come  on  to  my  land  and  set  up  camp there.  Again,  depending  on  the  evidence,  I  shall  be  able  to  obtain  an  injunction (interlocutory and final) against them remaining and also against them coming back again once they leave as required by the injunction. Similarly, if the evidence shows that, once they leave, they are likely to move and set up camp on other land which I own, the court can  grant  an  injunction  (interlocutory  and  final)  against  them  doing  that.  If  authority  is needed  for  all  this,  it  can  be  found  in  the  judgment  of  Lord  Diplock  in  the  Court  of Appeal in Manchester Corporation v Connolly [1970] Ch 420. 2. Of course, it is quite likely that I won’t know the identities of at least some of the trespassers. If so, Wilson J regarded an injunction as “useless” since “it would be wholly impracticable  for  the  claimant  to  seek  the  committal  to  prison  of  a  probably  changing group of not easily identifiable travellers, including establishing service of the injunction and  of  the  application”:  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Environment  v  Drury  [2004]  1  WLR 1906,  1912,  para  19.  That  may  well  have  been  an  unduly  pessimistic  assessment. Certainly, claimants have used injunctions against unnamed defendants. And Sir Andrew Morritt V-C was satisfied that the procedural problems could be overcome. Admittedly, the  circumstances  in  the  first  of  his  cases,  Bloomsbury  Publishing  Group  Ltd  and  J  K Rowling  v  News  Group  Newspapers  Ltd  and  a  Person  or  Persons  Unknown  [2003] EWHC  1205  (Ch),  were  very  different  from  a  situation  involving  trespassers.  But trespassing protesters were the target of the interlocutory injunction which he granted in Hampshire Waste Services Ltd v Persons Intending to Trespass and/or Trespassing upon Incinerator  Sites  [2003]  EWHC  1738  (Ch).  Similarly,  in  South  Cambridgeshire  DC  v Persons Unknown [2004] EWCA Civ 1280 the Court of Appeal (Brooke and Clarke LJJ) granted  an  injunction  against  persons  unknown  “causing  or  permitting  hardcore  to  be deposited,  caravans,  mobile  homes  or  other  forms  of  residential  accommodation  to  be stationed, or existing caravans or other mobile homes to be occupied on land” adjacent to a gypsy encampment in rural Cambridgeshire. Brooke LJ commented, at para 8: “There was  some  difficulty  in  times  gone  by  against  obtaining  relief  against  persons  unknown, but over the years that problem has been remedied either by statute or by rule.” See the discussion  of  such  injunctions  in  Jillaine  Seymour,  “Injunctions  Enjoining  Non-Parties: Distinction without Difference” (2007) 66 CLJ 605-624. The  present  case  concerns  travellers  who  set  up  camp  on  the  Forestry 3. Commission’s land at Hethfelton. Lord Neuberger has explained the circumstances. The identities of some, but not all, of those involved were known to the Commission. So the defendants  included  “persons  unknown”.  Despite  this,  the  Commission  sought  an injunction against all the defendants, including those described as “All persons currently living on or occupying the claimant’s land at Hethfelton.” The recorder declined to grant  Page 2 \\x0c          an injunction on the view that it would be disproportionate. But the Court of Appeal, by a majority, reversed the recorder on this point and granted an order that “The  respondents,  and  each  of  them,  be  restrained  from entering upon, trespassing upon, living on, or occupying the parcels  of  land set out in  the Schedule hereto, and, for the avoidance  of  doubt,  the  4th  respondent  shall  mean  ‘those people  trespassing  on,  living  on,  or  occupying  the  land known  as  Hethfelton  Wood  on  any  date  between  13th February  2007  and  3rd  August  2007  save  for  those specifically  identified  as  1st,  2nd,  3rd,  5th  and  6th respondents.’” In my view, for the reasons given by Lord Neuberger, the majority were right to grant the injunction. In any event, Mr Drabble QC, who appeared for the travellers, did not suggest that this injunction had been incompetent or defective for lack of service or in some other respect. Even Wilson LJ, who dissented on the injunction point in the Court of Appeal, did not go so far as to suggest that it was inherently useless: he simply took the view that it  added  nothing  of  value  to  the  order  for  possession  and,  therefore,  the  recorder  would have been entitled to exercise his discretion to refuse it on that basis: [2008] EWCA Civ 903, para 76. 4. This brings me to the order for possession which lies at the heart of the appeal.  If people  not  only  come  on  to  my  land  but  oust  me  from  it,  I  can  bring  an  action  for recovery of the land. That is what the Commission did in the present case: they raised an action in Poole county court for recovery of “land at Hethfelton nr Wool and all that land described  on  the  attached  schedule  all  in  the  County  of  Dorset.”  In  effect,  the Commission  were  asking  for  two  things:  to  be  put  back  into  possession  of  the  land  on which  the  defendants  were  camped  at  Hethfelton,  and  to  be  put  into  possession  of  the other  specified  areas  of  land  which  they  owned,  but  on  which,  they  anticipated,  the defendants might well set up camp once they left Hethfelton. 5. The Court of Appeal granted an order for possession in respect both of the land at Hethfelton and of the other parcels of land situated some distance away. As regards the competency  of  granting  an  extended  order  of  this  kind,  the  court  was  bound  by  the decision  in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Environment  v  Drury  [2004]  1  WLR  1906.  The central issue in the present appeal is whether that case was rightly decided. In my view it was not. 6. Most basically, an action for recovery of land presupposes that the claimant is not in possession of the relevant land: the defendant is in possession without the claimant’s  Page 3 \\x0c        permission. This remains the position even if, as the Court of Appeal held in Manchester Airport  v  Dutton  [2000]  QB  133,  the  claimant  no  longer  needs  to  have  an  estate  in  the land. See Megarry & Wade, The Law of Real Property (7th edition, 2008), para 4-026. To use  the  old  terminology,  the  defendant  has  ejected  the  claimant  from  the  land;  the claimant says that he has a better right to possess it, and he wants to recover possession. That  is  reflected  in  the  form  of  the  order  which  the  court  grants:  “that  the  claimant  do forthwith recover” the land - or, more fully, “that the said AB do recover against the said CD possession” of the land. See Cole, The Law and Practice in Ejectment (1857), p 786, Form 262. The fuller version has the advantage of showing that the court’s order is not in rem; it is in personam, directed against, and binding only, the defendant. Of course, if the defendant refuses to leave and the court grants a writ of possession requiring the bailiff to put the claimant into possession, in principle, the bailiff will remove all those who are on the  relevant  land,  irrespective  of  whether  or  not  they  were  parties  to  the  action:  R  v Wandsworth  County  Court  ex  parte  Wandsworth  LBC  [1975]  1  WLR  1314.  So,  in  that way,  non-parties  are  affected.  But,  if  anyone  on  the  land  has  a  better  right  than  the claimant to possession, he can apply to the court for leave to defend. If he proves his case, then he will be put into possession in preference to the claimant. But the original order for possession  will  continue  to  bind  the  original  defendant.  See  Stamp  J’s  lucid  account  of the law in In re Wykeham Terrace [1971] Ch 204, 209D-210B. In re Wykeham Terrace and Manchester Corporation v Connolly [1970] Ch 420 7. showed the need for some reform of the procedures used in actions for recovery of land. The twin problems of unidentifiable defendants and the lack of any facility for granting an  interim  order  for  possession  were  tackled  by  a  new  Order  113¸  the  provisions  of which, with some alteration of the details, have been incorporated into the current Rule 55 of the CPR. In the present case no issue arises about the wording of Rule 55. But I would certainly  not  interpret  “occupied”  in  Rule  55.1(b)  as  preventing  the  use  of  the  special procedure in a case like University of Essex v Djemal [1980] 1 WLR 1301 where some protesters were excluding the university from one part of its campus, but many students and members of staff were legitimately occupying other parts. 8. The intention behind the relevant provisions of Rule 55 remains the same as with Order 113: to provide a special fast procedure in cases which only involve trespassers and to  allow  the  use  of  that  procedure  even  when  some  or  all  of  the  trespassers  cannot  be identified. These important, but limited, changes in the rules cannot have been intended, however,  to  go  further  and  alter  the  essential  nature  of  the  action  itself:  it  remains  an action for recovery of possession of land from people who are in wrongful possession of it. I should add that in the present case the defendants do not dispute that they are – or, at least,  were  at  the  relevant  time  -  in  possession,  rather  than  mere  occupation,  of  the Commission’s land at Hethfelton. Wonnacott, Possession of Land (2006), p 27, points out that defendants rarely dispute this. But here, in any event, the defendants’ possession is borne out by their offer to co-operate to allow the Commission’s ordinary activities on the land  not  to  be  disrupted.  This  is  inconsistent  with  the  Commission  being  in  possession.  So the preconditions for an action for recovery of land are satisfied.  Page 4 \\x0c         By  contrast,  the  Forestry  Commission  were  at  all  relevant  times  in  undisturbed 9. possession  of  the  parcels  of  land  listed  in  the  schedule  to  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  order. That being so, an action for the recovery of possession of those parcels of land is quite inappropriate. The only authority cited by the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for the Environment v Drury [2004] 1 WLR 1906 for granting such an order was the decision of Saville J in Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food v Heyman (1990) 59 P & CR 48.  But in that case the defendant trespassers were not represented and so the point was not fully argued. Saville J referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in University of Essex v 10. Djemal  [1980]  1  WLR  1301,  which  I  have  just  mentioned.  That  decision  is  clearly distinguishable,  however.  The  defendant  students,  who  had  previously  taken  over,  and been  removed  from,  certain  administrative  offices  of  the  University  of  Essex,  had  been occupying  another  part  of  the  university  buildings  known  as  “Level  6”.  The  Court  of Appeal made an order for possession extending to the whole property of the university - in  effect,  the  whole  campus.  This  was  justified  because  the  university’s  right  to possession of its campus was indivisible: “If it is violated by adverse occupation of any part  of  the  premises,  that  violation  affects  the  right  of  possession  of  the  whole  of  the premises”: [1980] 1 WLR 1301, 1305C-D, per Shaw LJ. In the Heyman case, by contrast, the Ministry’s right to possession of its land at Grovely Woods was not violated in any way  by  the  trespassers’  adverse  possession  of  its  other  land  two  or  three  miles  away  at Hare  Wood.  In  my  view,  Heyman  was  wrongly  decided  and  did  not  form  a  legitimate basis for the Court of Appeal’s decision in Drury. 11.  Mummery  LJ  described  Wilson  J’s  approach  in  Drury  as  “pragmatic”:  [2004]  1 WLR  1906,  1916,  para  35.  And,  of  course,  the  common  law  does  evolve  by  making pragmatic  incremental  developments.  But,  if  they  are  to  work,  they  must  be  consistent with basic principle and they must make sense. 12. I would not put undue emphasis on the supposed practical difficulties in providing for  adequate  service  by  attaching  notices  to  stakes  etc  on  these  remoter  areas  of  land.  Doubtless,  adequate  arrangements  could  be  worked  out,  if  extended  orders  were otherwise desirable. The real objection is that the Court of Appeal’s extended order that “the  [Commission]  do  recover  the  parcels  of  land  set  out  in  the  Schedule  hereto”  is inconsistent with the fundamental nature of an action for recovering land because there is nothing  to  recover:  the  Commission  were  in  undisturbed  possession  of  those  parcels  of land.  And  the  law  is  harmed  rather  than  improved  if  a  court  grants  orders  which  lay defendants, knowing the facts, would rightly find incomprehensible. How, the defendants could  well  ask,  can  the  Commission  “recover”  parcels  of  land  which  they  already possess? How, too, are the defendants supposed to comply with the order?  Only a lawyer could understand and explain that the order “really” means that they are not to enter and take over possession of the other parcels of Commission land.  This is, of course, what the injunction already says in somewhat old-fashioned, but tolerably clear, language.  Page 5 \\x0c          Doubtless,  the  wording  could  in  theory  be  altered,  but  this  would  really  be  to 13. change the nature of the action and turn the order into an injunction, so creating parallel injunctions, one leading to the possible intervention of the bailiff and the other not. 14. The  claimed  justification  for  granting  an  extended  order  for  possession  of  this kind is indeed that it is the only effective remedy against travellers, such as the present defendants,  since  it  can  ultimately  lead  to  them  being  removed  by  a  bailiff  under  a warrant for possession. Moreover, unless the Commission can obtain an extended order, they will be forced to come back to court for a new order each time the defendants move to another of their properties.  An injunction is said to be a much weaker remedy in a case like the present since, if the defendants fail to comply with it, all that can be done is to seek  an  order  for  their  sequestration  or  committal  to  prison.  Sequestration  is  an  empty threat,  the  argument  continues,  against  people  who  have  few  assets,  while  committal  to prison might well be inappropriate in the case of defendants who are women with young children. 15. Plainly,  the  idea  of  the  Commission  having  to  return  to  court  time  and  again  to obtain a fresh order for possession in respect of a series of new sites is unattractive. But the scenario presupposes that the defendants would, with impunity, disobey the injunction restraining  them  from  entering  the  other  parcels  of  land.  So  this  point  is  linked  to  the contention that the injunction would not work. 16. I note in passing that there is actually no evidence that these defendants would fail to  comply  with  the  injunction  in  respect  of  the  other  parcels  of  land.  So  there  is  no particular  reason  to  suppose  that  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  injunction  will  prove  an ineffective  remedy  in  this  case.  On  the  more  general  point  about  the  alleged ineffectiveness of injunctions in cases of this kind, South Buckinghamshire DC v Porter [2003]  2  AC  558  is  of  some  interest.  There  the  council  wanted  to  obtain  an  injunction against  gypsies  living  in  caravans  in  breach  of  planning  controls  because  an  injunction was  thought  to  be  a  potentially  more  effective  weapon  than  the  various  enforcement procedures  under  the  planning  legislation.  This  is  in  line  with  the  thinking  behind  the application  for  an  injunction  in  South  Cambridgeshire  DC  v  Persons  Unknown  [2004] EWCA Civ 1280 which I mentioned in para 2. 17. Admittedly,  if  the  present  defendants  did  fail  to  comply  with  the  injunction, sequestration  would  not  be  a  real  option  since  they  are  unlikely  to  have  any  substantial assets.  And,  of  course,  there  are  potential  difficulties  in  a  court  trying  to  ensure compliance with an injunction by committing to prison defendants who are women with young  children.  Nevertheless,  as  Lord  Bingham  of  Cornhill  observed  in  South Buckinghamshire  DC  v  Porter  [2003]  2  AC  558,  580,  para  32,  in  connexion  with  a possible injunction against gypsies living in caravans in breach of planning controls:  Page 6 \\x0c              the  court  does  not injunction “When  granting  an contemplate that it will be disobeyed….Apprehension that a party may disobey an order should not deter the court from making an order otherwise appropriate: there is not one law for  the  law-abiding  and  another  for  the  lawless  and truculent.” Taking that approach, we should, in my view, be slow to assume that an injunction is a worthless remedy in a case like the present and that only the intervention of a bailiff is likely to be effective. If that is indeed the considered consensus of those with experience in  the  field,  then  consideration  may  have  to  be  given  to  changing  the  procedures  for enforcing injunctions of this kind. 18. But any such reform would raise far-reaching issues which are not for this court. In particular, travellers are by no means the only people without means whose unlawful activities  the  courts  seek  to  restrain  by  injunction  and  where  the  assistance  of  a  bailiff might be attractive to claimants. Especially when Parliament has intervened from time to time  to  regulate  the  way  that  the  courts  should  treat  travellers,  the  need  for  caution  in creating new remedies is obvious. At the very least, the matter is one for the Master of the Rolls and the Rules Council who have the leisure and facilities to consider the issues. For these reasons I would allow the defendants’ appeal to the extent proposed by 19. Lord Neuberger. LORD WALKER I agree with all the other members of the Court that this appeal should be allowed 20. to  the  extent  of  setting  aside  the  wider  possession  order.  In  Secretary  of  State  for  the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs v Drury [2004] 1 WLR 1906 the Court of Appeal went  too  far  in  trying  to  achieve  a  practical  solution.  The  decision  cannot  be  seen  as simply an extension of University of Essex v Djemal [1980] 1 WLR 1301, in which the facts  were  very  different.  I  respectfully  agree  with  the  observations  on  injunctive  relief made by Lord Rodger at the end of his judgment.  Page 7 \\x0c         LADY HALE 21. Two  questions  are  before  us.  First,  can  the  court  grant  a  possession  order  in respect of land, no part of which is yet occupied by the defendant, because of the fear that she will do so if ejected from land which she currently does occupy? Second, should the court grant an injunction against that feared trespass? The Court of Appeal unanimously answered  the  first  question  in  the  affirmative,  following  the  reasoning  of  that  Court  in Secretary  of  State  for the  Environment,  Food  and  Rural  Affairs  v  Drury  [2004]  EWCA Civ  200,  [2004]  1  WLR  1906,  CA,  and  the  decision  of  Saville  J  in  Ministry  of Agriculture,  Fisheries  and  Food  v  Heyman  (1989)  59  P  &  CR  48.  The  majority  also answered the second question in the affirmative; Wilson LJ dissented but only because he thought the wider possession order a sufficient remedy in the circumstances. 22. The  approach  in  Drury  and  Heyman  was  rightly  described  by  Mummery  LJ  in Drury  as  “pragmatic”  (para  35),  depending  as  it  did  upon  the  comparative  efficacy  of possession orders and injunctions. A possession order gives the claimant the right to call upon the bailiffs or the sheriff physically to remove the trespassers from his land, which is what he wants. An injunction can only be enforced by imposing penalties upon those who disobey.  Mummery  LJ  considered  it  a  “legitimate,  incremental  development”  of  the ruling of the Court of Appeal in University of Essex v Djemal [1980] 1 WLR 1301, that a possession  order  can  cover  a  greater  area  of  the  claimant’s  land  than  that  actually occupied by the trespassers. 23. The  situation  in  Djemal  was  very  like  the  situation  in  this  and  no  doubt  many other  cases.  The  University  of  Essex  consists  (mainly)  of  some  less  than  beautiful buildings  erected  in  the  1960s  upon  a  beautiful  campus  at  Wivenhoe  Park  near Colchester.  The  students  had  occupied  a  small  part  of  the  University  buildings.  The University wanted an order covering the whole of the University premises. The judge had given them an order covering only the part actually occupied by the students. The Court of  Appeal  made  the  wider  order  sought  by  the  University,  holding  that  there  was jurisdiction to cover “the whole of the owner’s property in respect of which his right of occupation  has  been  interfered  with”  (per  Buckley  LJ  at  p  1304E,  emphasis  supplied). Shaw LJ reasoned that the right of the University to possession of the site and buildings was “indivisible. If it is violated by adverse occupation of any part of the premises, that violation affects the right of possession of the whole of the premises” (p 1305D, emphasis supplied).  These  were  extempore  judgments  in  a  case  where  the  students  had  already decided  to  call  off  their  direct  action,  but  it  will  noted  that  Buckley  LJ  spoke  of interference  with  a  right  of  occupation,  while  Shaw  LJ  spoke  of  violation  of  a  right  of possession.  24. The defendants in this case are occupying only part of Hethfelton Wood. We can, I think, assume that the Forestry Commission are occupying the rest. They are carrying on their  forestry  work  as  best  they  can  –  indeed,  one  of  their  problems  is  that  they  are  Page 8 \\x0c        impeded from doing it because of the risk of harm to the vehicles and their occupants. Yet Mr Drabble, for the defendant appellants, has never resisted an order covering the whole of Hethfelton Wood, nor does he invite us to disagree with Djemal. Being a sensible man, he  recognises  that  we  would  be  disinclined  to  hold  that  if  trespassers  set  up  camp  in  a large garden the householder can obtain an order enabling them to be physically removed only from that part of the garden which they have occupied, even if it is clear that they will then simply move their tents to another part of the garden. 25. The  questions  raised  by  this  case  and  Djemal  should  be  seen  as  questions  of principle  rather  than  pragmatism  or  procedure.  Still  less  should  they  be  answered  by reference  to  the  forms  of  action  which  were  supposedly  abolished  in  1876.  The underlying  principle  is  ubi  ius,  ibi  remedium:  where  there  is  a  right,  there  should  be  a remedy to fit the right. The fact that “this has never been done before” is no deterrent to the  principled  development  of  the  remedy  to  fit  the  right,  provided  that  there  is  proper procedural  protection  for  those  against  whom  the  remedy  may  be  granted.  So  the questions are: what is the right to be protected? And what is the appropriate remedy to fit it? 26. If we were approaching this case afresh, without the benefit and burden of history, we  might  think  that  the  right  to  be  protected  is  the  right  to  the  physical  occupation  of tangible land. A remedy should be available against anyone who does not have that right and  is  interfering  with  it  by  occupying  the  land.  That  remedy  should  provide  for  the physical removal of the interlopers if need be. The scope of the remedy actually granted in any individual case should depend upon the scope of the right, the extent of the actual and  threatened  interference  with  it,  and  the  adequacy  of  the  procedural  safeguards available to those at risk of physical removal. 27. In considering the nature and scope of any judicial remedy, the parallel existence of  a  right  of  self  help  against  trespassers  must  not  be  forgotten,  because  the  rights protected  by  self  help  should  mirror  the  rights  that  can  be  protected  by  judicial  order, even  if  the  scope  of  self  help  has  been  curtailed  by  statute.  No  civil  wrong  is  done  by turning out a trespasser using no more force than is reasonably necessary: see Hemmings v Stoke Poges Golf Club [1920] 1 KB 720. In Cole on Ejectment (London, Sweet, 1857), a  comprehensive  textbook  written  after  the  Common  Law  Procedure  Act  1852,  there  is considerable discussion (in ch VII) of the comparative merits of self help and ejectment. Any person with a right to enter and take possession of the land might choose simply to do that rather than to sue in ejectment. But this was not advised where the right of entry was not clear and beyond doubt, or where resistance was to be expected. The effect of the criminal statutes against forcible entry was “by no means clear”: whether no force at all, or only reasonable force, might be used against the trespasser. Cole was not as sanguine as was Lord Denning MR in McPhail v Persons, Names Unknown [1973] Ch 447, 456. Lord Denning took the  view  that  the  statutes against forcible entry did not  apply to the use  of  reasonable  force  against  trespassers.  Those  statutes  have  now  been  replaced  by section  6  of  the  Criminal  Law  Act  1977.  This  prohibits  the  use  or  threat  of  violence against  person  or  property  for  the  purpose  of  securing  entry  to  any  premises  without  Page 9 \\x0c          lawful excuse. But it also provides that a right to possession or occupation of the premises is no excuse, although there is now an exception for a “displaced residential occupier” or “protected intending occupier”. This does not include the Forestry Commission, although it  is  not  impossible  that  they  would  be  able  to  evict  the  travellers  without  offending against the criminal law. But in any event, the use of self help, even if it can be lawfully achieved, is not encouraged because of the risk of disorder that it may entail. 28. Lord Denning considered that the statutes of forcible entry did not apply because the trespassing squatters in McPhail were not in possession of the land at all. He quoted Pollock on Torts (15th ed 1951, p 292): “A trespasser may in any case be turned off land before he has  gained  possession,  and  he  does  not  gain  possession until  there  has  been  something  like  acquiescence  in  the physical  fact  of  his  occupation  on  the  part  of  the  rightful owner.”   A  trespasser  who  merely  interferes  with  the  right  to  possession  or  occupation  of  the property may also be ejected with the use of reasonable force: one does not need to go to court, or even call the police, to eject a burglar or a poacher from one’s property. 29. Although Cole contemplated that self help might be used against a tenant who had wrongfully continued in occupation after the end of his tenancy, tenants are clearly now in a different position from squatters. Lord Denning thought that the statutes of forcible entry did apply to protect them (although Cole says that the authorities on which he relied had  later  been  overruled).  Most,  but  not  all,  residential  tenants  are  now  protected  by statute against eviction otherwise than by court order. This is a complicated area which need not concern us now as we are dealing with people who have never been granted any right to be where they are. 30. However, Lord Denning’s basic point is important here. “In a civilised society, the courts should themselves provide a remedy which is speedy and effective: and thus make self-help  unnecessary”  (McPhail,  p  457C).  It  seems  clear  that  the  right  of  self  help  has never been limited to those who have actually been dispossessed of their land: in fact on one view it is limited to those who have not been so dispossessed. There is no reason in principle why the remedy of physical removal from the land should only be available to those who have been completely dispossessed. It should not depend upon the niceties of whether  the  person  wrongfully  present  on  the  land  was  or  was  not  in  “possession”  in whatever legal sense the word is being used. Were the students in Djemal in possession of the  University’s  premises  at  all?  Lord  Denning,  supported  by  Sir  Frederick  Pollock, would  not  think  so:  see  McPhail  at  456F.  Were  these  new  travellers  in  possession  of  Page 10 \\x0c         Hethfelton Wood at all? Again, Lord Denning would not think so. They had parked their vehicles  there,  but  the  work  of  the  Forestry  Commission  was  going  on  around  them  as best it could. 31. If we accept that the remedy should be available to a person whose possession or occupation  has  been  interfered  with  by  the  trespassers,  as  well  as  to  a  person  who  has been totally dispossessed, a case like Djemal becomes completely understandable, as does the order for possession of the whole of Hethfelton Wood in this case. Nor need we be troubled by the form of the order, that the claimant “recover” the land. His occupation of the whole has been interfered with and he may recover his full control of the whole from those who are interfering with it. 32. As is obvious from the above, a great deal of confusion is caused by the different meanings of the word “possession” and its overlap with occupation. As Mark Wonnacott points out in his interesting monograph, Possession of Land (Cambridge University Press, 2006),  the  term  “possession”  is  used  in  three  quite  distinct  senses  in  English  land  law: “first, in its proper, technical sense, as a description of the relationship between a person and  an  estate  in  land;  secondly,  in  its  vulgar  sense  of  physical  occupation  of  tangible land” (the third sense need not concern us here). Possession, in its first sense, he divides into a relationship of right, the right to the legal estate in question, and a relationship of fact,  the  actual  enjoyment  of  the  legal  estate  in  question;  a  person  might  have  the  one without  the  other.  Possession  of  a  legal  estate  in  fact  may  often  overlap  with  actual occupation  of  tangible  land,  but  they  are  conceptually  distinct:  a  person  may  be  in possession of the head-lease if he collects rents from the sub-tenants, but he will not be in physical occupation of tangible land.       33. The modern action for the possession of land is the successor to the common law action  of  ejectment  (and  some  statutory  remedies  developed  for  use  in  the  county  and magistrates’ courts in the 19th century). The ejectment in question was not the ejectment sought by the action but the wrongful ejectment of the right holder. Its origins lay in the writ of trespass, an action for compensatory damages rather than recovery of the estate. But the common law action to recover the estate was only available to freeholders and not to term-holders (tenants). So the judges decided that this form of trespass could be used by tenants to recover their terms. Trespass was a more efficient form of action than the medieval real actions, such as novel disseisin, so this put tenants in a better position than freeholders. As is well known, the device of involving real people as notional lessees and ejectors was used to enable freeholders to sue the real ejectors. These were then replaced by the fictional characters John Doe and Richard Roe. Eventually the medieval remedies were  (mostly)  abolished  by  the  Real  Property  Limitation  Act  of  1833;  the  fictional characters of John Doe and Richard Roe by the Common Law Procedure Act 1852; and the  forms  of  action  themselves  by  the  Judicature  Acts  1873-75  (see  AWB  Simpson,  A History of the Land Law, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 2nd edition 1986, ch VII).  Page 11 \\x0c        34. The question for us is whether the remedy of a possession action should be limited to  deciding  disputes  about  “possession”  in  the  technical  sense  described  by  Wonnacott. The discussion in Cole on Ejectment concentrates on disputes between two persons, both claiming the right to possession of the land, one in occupation and the other not. Often these  are  between  landlords  and  tenants  who  have  remained  in  possession  when  the landlord thinks that their time is up. But it is clear that in reality what was being protected by the action was the right to physical occupation of the land, not the right to possession of a legal estate in land. The head lessee who was merely collecting the rents would not be  able  to  bring  an  action  which  would  result  in  his  gaining  physical  occupation  of  the land unless he was entitled to it.    35. It  seems  clear  that  the  modern  possession  action  is  there  to  protect  the  right  to physical occupation of the land against those who are wrongfully interfering with it. The right  protected,  to  the  physical  occupation  of  the  land,  and  the  remedy  available,  the removal  of  those  who  are  wrongfully  there,  should  match  one  another.  The  action  for possession of land has evolved out of ejectment which itself evolved out of the action for trespass. There is nothing in CPR Part 55 which is inconsistent with this view, far from it. The distinction is drawn between a “possession claim” which is a claim for the recovery of possession of land (r 55.1.(a)) and a “possession claim against trespassers” which is a claim for the recovery of land which the claimant alleges is “occupied only by a person or persons who entered or remained on the land without the consent of a person entitled to possession  of  that  land  .  .  .  ”  The  object  is  to  distinguish  between  the  procedures  to  be used where a tenant remains in occupation after the end of his tenancy and the procedures to be used where there are squatters or others who have never been given permission to enter or remain on the land. That, to my mind, is the reason for inserting “only”: not to exclude the possibility that the person taking action to enforce his right to occupy is also in occupation of it. There is then provision for taking action against “persons unknown”. But the remedy in each case is the same: an order for physical removal from the land. 36. It  was  held  in  R  v  Wandsworth  County  Court,  ex  parte  Wandsworth  London Borough  Council  [1975]  1  WLR  1314,  that  a  bailiff  executing  a  possession  warrant  is entitled to evict anyone found on the premises whether they were party to the judgment or not. However, there is nothing to prevent the order distinguishing between those who are and those who are not lawfully there, provided that some means is specified of identifying them.  No-one  would  suggest  that  an  order  for  possession  of  Hethfelton  Wood  would allow  the  removal  of  Forestry  Commission  workers  or  picnickers  who  happened  to  be there when the bailiffs went in. In principle, court orders should be tailored to fit the facts and the rights they are enforcing rather than the other way around. 37. This does not, however, solve the principal question before us. What is the extent of the premises to which the order may relate? As Mummery LJ suggested in Drury, at para 31, the origin was in an action to recover a term of years. The land covered by the term would be defined in the grant. It would not extend to all the land anywhere in the lawful possession of the claimant. Equally, however, as discussed earlier, the remedy can be granted in respect of land to which the claimant is entitled even though the trespasser  Page 12 \\x0c         is not technically in possession of it. This suggests that the scope may be wider than the actual physical space occupied by the trespasser, who may well move about from time to time. In any event, the usual rule is that possession of part is possession of the whole, thus begging  the  question  of  how  far  the  “whole”  may  extend.  It  was  suggested  during argument that it might extend to all the land in the same title at the Land Registry. This could be seen as the modern equivalent of the “estate” from which the claimant had been unlawfully  ousted.  But  this  is  artificial  when  a  single  parcel  of  land  may  well  be  a combination of several different registered titles. 38. The  main  objection  to  extending  the  order to  land  some  distance  away  from  the parcel  which  has  actually  been  intruded  upon  is  one  of  natural  justice.  Before  any coercive order is made, the person against whom it is made must have an opportunity of contesting it, unless there is an emergency. In the case of named defendants, such as the appellants  here,  this  need  not  be  an  obstacle.  They  have  the  opportunity  of  coming  to court to contest the order both in principle and in scope. The difficulty lies with “persons unknown”.  They  are  brought  into  the  action  by  the  process  of  serving  notice  not  on individuals but on the land. If it were to be  possible to enforce the physical removal of “persons unknown” from land on which they had not yet trespassed when the order was made,  notice  would  also  have  to  be  given  on  that  land  too.  That  might  be  thought  an evolution too far. Whatever else a possession order may be or have been, it has always been a remedy for a present wrongful interference with the right to occupy. There is an intrusion and the person intruded upon has the right to throw the intruder out.  39. Thus, while I would translate the modern remedy into modern terms designed to match the remedy to the rights protected, and would certainly not put too much weight on the word “recover”, I would hesitate to apply it to quite separate land which has not yet been  intruded  upon.  The  more  natural  remedy  would  be  an  injunction  against  that intrusion,  and  I  would  not  be  unduly  hesitant  in  granting  that.  We  should  assume  that people will obey the law, and in particular the targeted orders of the court, rather than that they will not.  We should not be  too ready  to speculate  about the enforcement  measures which  might  or  might  not  be  appropriate  if  it  is  broken.  But  the  main  purpose  of  an injunction  would  be  to  support  a  very  speedy  possession  order,  with  severely  abridged time limits, if it is broken. 40. However, I would not see these procedural obstacles as necessarily precluding the “incremental development” which was sanctioned in Drury. Provided that an order can be specifically  tailored  against  known  individuals  who  have  already  intruded  upon  the claimant’s land, are threatening to do so again, and have been given a proper opportunity to  contest  the  order,  I  see  no  reason  in  principle  why  it  should  not  be  so  developed.  It would  be  helpful  if  the  Rules  provided  for  it,  so  that  the  procedures  could  be  properly thought through and the forms of order properly tailored to the facts of the case. The main problem at the moment is the “scatter-gun” form of the usual order (though it is not one prescribed by the Rules).  Page 13 \\x0c            It  is  for  that  reason,  and  that  reason  alone,  that  I  would  allow  this  appeal  to  the 41. extent of setting aside the wider possession order made in the Court of Appeal.              LORD NEUBERGER 42. There is an acute shortage of sites in this country to satisfy the needs of travellers, people who prefer a nomadic way of life. Thus, in the county in which the travellers in this case pitched their camp, Dorset, it has been estimated that over 400 additional pitches are required. The inevitable consequence is that travellers establish their camps on land which  they  are  not  entitled  to  occupy,  normally  as  trespassers,  and  almost  always  in breach of  planning control.  Proceedings  seeking to prevent  their occupation have led to human  rights  issues  being  raised  before  domestic  courts  (for  instance,  in  the  House  of Lords, Doherty v Birmingham City Council [2008] UKHL 57), and before the European Court  of  Human  Rights  (for  instance,  Connors  v  United  Kingdom  (2005)  40  EHRR  9). The  present  appeal,  however,  raises  issues  of  purely  domestic  law,  namely  the permissible  physical  ambit  of  any  possession  order  made  against  trespassing  travellers, and the appropriateness of granting an injunction against them. The facts and procedural history 43. Travellers often set up their camps in wooded areas. Many woods and forests in this country are managed by the Forestry Commission (“the Commission”) and owned by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The functions of the Commission are “promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the  production  and  supply  of  timber  and  other  forest  products  …”  –  section  1  of  the Forestry Act 1967. The Commission runs its woods and forests commercially, although it affords members of the public relatively free and unrestricted access to such areas.  44. All  undeveloped  land  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  susceptible  to  unauthorised occupation  by  travellers,  and  much  of  such  land  is  vested  in  public  bodies.  But  land managed by the Commission is particularly vulnerable to incursion by travellers. As the Recorder  who  heard  this  case  at  first  instance  said,  “[g]iven  the  public  access  that  it affords  to  its  land  and  its  needs  for  access  for  forestry  vehicles,  it  is  not  protected  and barricaded  in  the  same  way  as  much  of  the  other  land  in  private  and  local  authority ownership in Dorset is now protected”.  Page 14 \\x0c        45. In 2004, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister issued “Guidance on Managing Unauthorised Camping” (“the 2004 Guidance”). This suggests that local authorities and other  public  bodies  distinguish  between  unauthorised  encampment  locations  which  are “unacceptable”  (for  instance,  because  they  involve  traffic  hazard  or  public  health  risks) and  those  which  are  “acceptable”.  It  further  recommends  that  the  “management  of unauthorised  camping  must  be  integrated”,  and  states  that  “each  encampment  location must  be  considered  on  its  merits”.  The  2004  Guidance  also  indicates  that  specified welfare enquiries  should  be  undertaken in relation to  the travellers and their  families in any  unauthorised  encampment  before  any  decision  is  made  as  to  whether  to  bring proceedings  to  evict  them.  The  Secretary  of  State  has  accepted  throughout  these proceedings that the  Commission  should comply  with  the  terms  of  the  2004  Guidelines before possession proceedings are brought against any travellers on land it manages, and that failure to do so may invalidate such proceedings. One  of the  Commission the  woods  managed  by 46. is  Hethfelton  Wood (“Hethfelton”), near Wool, where, at the end of January 2007, a number of new travellers established  an  unauthorised  camp.  After  the  Commission  had  carried  out  the  enquiries recommended  by  the  2004  Guidance,  the  Secretary  of  State  issued  the  current proceedings,  a  possession  claim  against  trespassers  within  CPR  55.1(b),  and  an application  for  an  injunction,  in  the  Poole  County  Court,  on  13  February  2007.  The original defendants were Natalie Meier, Robert and Georgie Laidlaw, Sharon Horie and “Persons  Names  Unknown”.  Ms  Meier  travels  and  lives  in  a  vehicle  with  her  two children,  having  done  so  since  2002.  Mr  Laidlaw  sadly  died  before  the  hearing,  and, unsurprisingly  in  the  circumstances,  Mrs  Laidlaw  appears  to  have  played  no  part  in  the proceedings. Ms Horie has pursued a nomadic way of life since about 1982, and lives in vehicles  together  with  her  three  children.  Lesley  Rand  (who  has  been  a  traveller  since about  1996,  and  lives  together  with  her  severely  disabled  nine  year  old  daughter  in  a specially adapted vehicle) and Kirsty Salter (who was pregnant at the time, and has been a traveller for ten years) were subsequently added as defendants.  47. Two  of  the  defendants  had  previously  been  encamped  on  another  area  of woodland,  some  five  miles  from  Hethfelton,  called  Moreton  Plantation  (“Moreton”), which  was  also  managed  by  the  Commission.  Following  the  issue  of  possession proceedings in relation to Moreton, a compromise was agreed on 9 January 2007, which provided that the Secretary of State should recover possession on 29 January 2007. It was on that day that a number of the defendants moved from Moreton to Hethfelton. Some of the other defendants had previously occupied another wood managed by the Commission, Morden  Heath  (“Morden”),  which  had  also  been  subject  to  proceedings  brought  by  the Secretary of State, which had resulted in a possession order which was due to be executed on 5 February 2007. In anticipation of the execution of that order, those other defendants moved from Morden to Hethfelton. 48. In  the  claim  form  in  the  instant  proceedings,  the  Secretary  of  State  sought possession  not  only  of  Hethfelton,  but  also  of  “all  that  land  described  on  the  attached schedule  all  in  the  county  of  Dorset”.  That  schedule  set  out  more  than  fifty  separate  Page 15 \\x0c         woods,  which  were  owned  by  the  Secretary  of  State  and  managed  by  the  Commission, and which were marked on an attached plan. The number of woods of which possession was sought in addition to Hethfelton was subsequently reduced to thirteen, and the plan showed that those thirteen woods (“the other woods”) were spread over an area of Dorset around  twenty-five  miles  east  to  west  and  ten  miles  north  to  south.  In  the  injunction application, the Secretary of State sought an order against the same defendants (including “Persons  Names  Unknown”)  restraining  them  “from  re-entering  [Hethfelton]  or  from entering [the other woods]”. Copies of the claim form seeking possession were served on the named defendants and at Hethfelton in accordance with the provisions of CPR 55.6, together with copies of the injunction application. 49. The  evidence  established  that  all  the  occupiers  of  the  camp  at  Hethfelton  were new  travellers,  living  and  travelling  in  motor  vehicles,  mostly  with  children  and  often with animals. The evidence also indicated that the camp was relatively tidy, and did not involve any antisocial conduct on the part of any of the occupants. However, the presence of  children  and  animals  caused  the  Commission  to  avoid  the  use  of  heavy  plant  or  the carrying  out  of  substantial  work,  which  might  otherwise  have  occurred,  in  the surrounding area. The Commission’s evidence showed that other areas in Dorset managed by the Commission, in addition to Hethfelton, including Moreton, and Morden, had been occupied  by  travellers  as  unauthorised  camps,  sometimes  by  one  or  more  of  the  named defendants.  50. The  claim  came  before  Mr  Recorder  Norman,  who  gave  a  full  and  careful judgment on 3 August 2007. He had to resolve three issues. The first was whether to grant an order for possession against the defendants in respect of Hethfelton. The second issue was whether to grant an order for possession in respect of any or all of the other woods. The  third  issue  was  whether  to  grant  an  injunction  restraining  the  defendants  from entering on to all or any of the other woods. 51. The  Recorder  decided  to  grant  an  order  for  possession  against  the  defendants  in respect of Hethfelton. However, he refused to make any wider order for possession, or to grant  the injunction sought  by the Secretary of State. Although he accepted that he had jurisdiction to make such orders, he considered it inappropriate to do so primarily because the  Commission  had  failed  to  consider  the  matters  suggested  by  the  2004  Guidance before  the  current  proceedings  were  begun,  and  because  the  Commission  was  not prepared to assure the Recorder that consideration would be given to that guidance before any wider order for possession or any injunction was enforced. Paragraph 1 of the order drawn  up  to  reflect  this  decision  provided  that  “[t]he  claimant  do  forthwith  recover  the land known as Hethfelton Wood”.   52. The  defendants  did  not  appeal  against  this  order  for  possession.  However,  the Secretary of State appealed against the Recorder’s refusal to grant an order for possession in relation to the other woods (which I will refer to as a “wider order for possession”) and  Page 16 \\x0c          the  injunction,  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  allowed  the  appeal  –  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  903, [2009] 1 WLR 828. The order made by the Court of Appeal ordered that the Secretary of State “do recover” the other woods, and that each of the defendants “be restrained from entering upon, trespassing upon, living on, or occupying” any of the other woods. 53. In  her  judgment,  Arden  LJ  followed  and  applied  the  reasoning  of  the  Court  of Appeal  in  the  earlier  decision  of  Secretary  of  State  v  Drury  [2004]  EWCA  Civ  200, [2004] 1 WLR 1906, under which it had been held that an order for possession, at least when made pursuant to a possession claim against trespassers, could, in appropriate cases, extend  to  land  not  forming  part  of,  or  contiguous  with,  or  even  near,  the  land  actually occupied  by  the  trespassers.  She  concluded  that  the  evidence  demonstrated  that  at  least some of the defendants had set up unauthorised encampments on woods managed by the Commission  in  Dorset,  and  that  there  was  a  substantial  risk  that  at  least  some  of  the defendants would move onto other such woods once an order for possession was made in relation to Hethfelton.  54. Arden LJ also said, in disagreement with the Recorder, that any failure on the part of  the  Commission  to  consider  the  matters  recommended  by  the  2004  Guidance  before issuing the proceedings for possession of the other woods did not justify refusing to make such a wider order. This was essentially on the basis that, if there was any such failure, it could be considered at the time the wider order for possession was sought to be enforced. Pill  and  Wilson  LJJ  agreed.  Arden  LJ  also  considered  that,  for  the  same  reasons,  the Recorder had been wrong to refuse the injunction sought  by  the Secretary  of  State,  and again Pill LJ agreed. However, Wilson LJ dissented on this point, on  the ground that the Recorder had been entitled to refuse an injunction  on the additional ground which he had mentioned, namely that, if he had made a wider order for possession, it would have been disproportionate to grant an injunction as well. 55. The  instant  appeal  is  brought  by  Ms  Horie  and  Ms  Rand,  and  it  raises  two principal issues. The first is the extent to which an order for possession can be made in favour of a claimant in respect of land not actually occupied by a defendant. The second issue  concerns  the  circumstances  in  which  an  injunction  restraining  future  trespass  can and should be granted; this raises two points: (a) whether an injunction against travellers is generally appropriate, and (b) the point on which the Court of Appeal differed from the Recorder,  namely  the  effect  of  the  2004  Guidance.  I  shall  consider  these  two  issues  in turn and then briefly review the implications of my conclusions. An order for possession of land not occupied by the defendants 56. In  Drury  [2004]  1  WLR  1906,  the  facts  were  similar  to  those  here,  except  the Court  of  Appeal  held  that  there  was  no  evidence  establishing  that  the  travellers  in  that  Page 17 \\x0c         case had occupied, or threatened to occupy, other property managed by the Commission. Accordingly,  the  order  for  possession  was  in  the  normal  form,  limited,  like  the  order made by the Recorder in this case, to the wood occupied by the travellers. However, the Court  of  Appeal  decided  that  an  order  for  possession  could  be  granted,  not  merely  in respect of land which the defendant occupied, but also in respect of other land which was owned by the claimant, and which the defendant threatened to occupy.  57. The  essence  of  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  reasoning  was  that  (a)  the  law  recognises that an anticipated trespass can give rise to a right of action, (b) an injunction would be of limited,  if  any,  real  use,  (c)  in  those  circumstances,  the  law  should  provide  another remedy, (d) a wider order for possession would be of much more practical value than an injunction, (e) such an order for possession was justified by previous authority and in the light of the court’s jurisdiction to grant quia timet injunctions; and (f) accordingly, such an  order  could  be  made;  but  (g)  it  should  only  be  made  in  relatively  exceptional circumstances – see at [2004] 1 WLR 1906, paras 20-24, 34-36, and 42-46, per Wilson J, Mummery LJ and Ward LJ respectively.  58. Particularly  with  the  advent  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Rules,  it  is  clear  that  judges should  strive  to  ensure  that  court  procedures  are  efficacious,  and  that,  where  there  is  a threatened or actual wrong, there should be an effective remedy to prevent it or to remedy it. Further, as Lady Hale points out, so long as landowners are entitled to evict trespassers physically,  judges  should  ensure  that  the  more  attractive  and  civilised  option  of  court proceedings  is  as  quick  and  efficacious  as  legally  possible.  Accordingly,  the  Court  of Appeal was plainly right to seek to identify an effective remedy for the problem faced by the Commission as a result of unauthorised encampments, namely that, when a possession order  is  made  in  respect  of  one  wood,  the  travellers  simply  move  on  to  another  wood, requiring  the  Commission  to  incur  the  cost,  effort  and  delay  of  bringing  a  series  or potentially endless series of possession proceedings against the same people.  59. Nonetheless,  however  desirable  it  is  to  fashion  or  develop  a  remedy  to  meet  a particular problem, courts have to act within the law, and their ability to control procedure and achieve justice is not unlimited. Judges are  not  legislators, and there comes  a  point where,  in  order  to  deal  with  a  particular  problem,  court  rules  and  practice  cannot  be developed by the courts, but have to be changed by primary or secondary legislation – or, in so far as they can be invoked for that purpose, by Practice Directions. In my view, it is simply not possible to make the sort of enlarged or wider order for possession which the Court  of  Appeal  made  in  this  case,  following  (as  it  was,  I  think,  bound  to  do)  the reasoning in Drury [2004] 1 WLR 1906. 60. The power of the County Court for present purposes derives from section 21(1) of the County Courts Act 1984, which gives it “jurisdiction to hear and determine any action for  the  recovery  of  land”.  The  concept  of  “recovery”  of  land  was  the  essence  of  a possession order both before and after the procedure was recast by sections 168ff of the  Page 18 \\x0c         Common Law Procedure Act 1852, although, until the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875, the action lay in ejectment rather than in recovery of land - see per Lord Denning MR  in  McPhail  v  Persons,  Names  Unknown  [1973]  Ch  447,  457-8.  Nonetheless,  the change  of  name  did  not  involve  a  change  of  substance,  and  the  essence  of  an  order  for possession, whether framed in ejectment or recovery, is that the claimant is getting back the property from the defendant, whether by recovering the property from the defendant or  because  the  claimant  had  been  wrongly  ejected  by  the  defendant.  As  stated  by Wonnacott,  in  Possession  of  Land  (2006),  page  22,  “an  action  for  recovery  of  land (ejectment) is an action to be put into possession of an estate of land. The complaint is that  the  claimant  is  not  currently  ‘in’  possession  of  it,  and  …  wants  …  to  be  put  ‘in’ possession of it.” See also Simpson, A History of the Land Law (2nd edition), pages 144-5 and Gledhill v Hunter (1880) 14 Ch D 492, 496 per Sir George Jessel MR. 61. As Sir George Jessel explained, an action for ejectment and its successor, recovery of land, was normally issued “to recover possession from a tenant” or former tenant. An action  against  a  trespasser,  who  did  not  actually  dispossess  the  person  entitled  to possession, was based on trespass quare clausum fregit, physical intrusion onto the land. Nonetheless,  where  a  trespasser  exclusively  occupies  land,  so  as  to  oust  the  person entitled to possession, the cause of action must be for recovery of possession. (Hence, if such an action  is  not brought within twelve years the ousting trespasser will often have acquired  title  by  “adverse  possession”.)  Accordingly,  in  cases  where  a  trespasser  is actually  in  possession  of  land,  an  action  for  recovery  of  land,  i.e.  for  possession,  is appropriate, as Lord Denning implicitly accepted in McPhail [1973] Ch 447, 457-8.  62. This  analysis  is  substantially  reflected  in  the  provisions  of  the  CPR  and  in  the currently prescribed form of order for possession. CPR 55 is concerned with possession claims, and CPR 55.1 provides: “(a) ‘a possession claim’ means a claim for the recovery of  possession  of  land  (including  buildings  or  parts  of buildings); (b)  ‘a  possession  claim  against  trespassers’  means  a  claim for  the  recovery  of  land  which  the  claimant  alleges  is occupied  only  by  a  person  or  persons  who  entered  or remained  on  the  land  without  the  consent  of  a  person entitled  to  possession  of  that  land  but  does  not  include  a claim against a tenant or sub-tenant whether his tenancy has been terminated or not; …” The  special  features  of  a  possession  claim  against  trespassers  are  that  the  defendants  to the claim may include “persons unknown”, such proceedings should be served on the land as well as on the named defendants, and the minimum period between service and hearing  Page 19 \\x0c         is 2 days (or 5 days for residential property) rather than the 28 days for other possession claims - see CPR 55.3(4), 55.6, and 55.5(2) and (3). 63. The drafting of CPR 55(1) is rather peculiar in that, unlike that in CPR 55(1)(a), the definition in CPR 55(1)(b) does not include the word “possession”. Given that, since 1875, the cause of action has been for recovery of land, the oddity, as Lord Rodger has pointed out, is the inclusion of the word “possession” in the former paragraph, rather than its  exclusion  in  the  latter.  However,  in  so  far  as  the  point  has  any  significance,  the definition of “a possession claim”, like the definition of “land”, in CPR 55(1)(a) may well be  carried  into  CPR  55(1)(b).  In  any  event,  the  important  point,  to  my  mind,  is  that  a possession claim against trespassers involves the person “entitled to possession” seeking “recovery”  of  the  land.  Form  N26  is  the  prescribed  form  of  order  in  both  a  simple possession claim and a possession claim against trespassers (see CPR Part 4 PD Table 1). That form orders the defendant to “give the claimant possession” of the land in question. Although the orders at first instance (as drafted by counsel), and in the Court of Appeal, direct that the claimant do “recover” the land in question from the defendants, that is the mirror image of ordering that the defendants “give” the claimant possession.  64. The  notion  that  an  order  for  possession  may  be  sought  by  a  claimant  and  made against defendants in respect of land which is wholly detached and separated, possibly by many  miles,  from  that  occupied  by  the  defendants,  accordingly  seems  to  me  to  be difficult, indeed impossible, to justify. The defendants do not occupy or possess such land in any conceivable way, and the claimant enjoys uninterrupted possession of it. Equally, the defendants have not ejected the claimant from such land. For the same reasons, it does not make sense to talk about the claimant recovering possession of such land, or to order the defendant to deliver up possession of such land. 65. This  does  not  mean  that,  where  trespassers  are  encamped  in  part  of  a  wood,  an order for possession cannot be made against them in respect of the whole of the wood (at least if there are no other occupants of the wood), just as much as an order for possession may extend to a whole house where the defendant is only trespassing in one room (at least if the rest of the house is empty).  66. However,  the  fact  that  an  order  for  possession  may  be  made  in  respect  of  the whole  of  a  piece  of  property,  when  the  defendant  is  only  in  occupation  of  part  and  the remainder  is  empty,  does  not  appear  to  me  to  assist  the  argument  in  favour  of  a  wider possession order as made by the Court of Appeal in this case. Self-help is a remedy still available,  in  principle,  to  a  landowner  against  trespassers  (other  than  former  residential tenants).  Where  only  part  of  his  property  is  occupied  by  trespassers,  a  landowner, exercising that remedy through privately instructed bailiffs, would, no doubt, be entitled to evict the trespassers from the whole of his property. Similarly, it seems to me, bailiffs (or  sheriffs),  who  are  required  by  a  warrant  (or  writ)  of  possession  to  evict  defendants from  part  of  a  property  owned  by  the  claimant,  would  be  entitled  to  remove  the  Page 20 \\x0c         defendants  from  the  whole  of  that  property.  But  that  does  not  mean  that  the  bailiffs, whether privately instructed or acting pursuant to a warrant, could restrain the trespassers from moving onto another property, perhaps miles away, owned by the claimant.  67. Further,  the  concept  of  occupying  part  of  property  (the  remainder  of  which  is vacant) effectively in the name of the whole is well established - see for example, albeit in  a  landlord  and  tenant  context,  Henderson  v  Squire  (1868-69)  LR  4  QB  170,  172. However,  that  concept  cannot  be  extended  to  apply  to  land  wholly  distinct,  even  miles away, from the occupied land. So, too, the fact that one can treat land as a single entity if it is divided by a road or river (in different ownership from the land) seems to me to be an irrelevance: as a matter of law and fact, the two divisions can sensibly be regarded as a single  piece  of  land.  Accordingly,  I  have  no  difficulty  with  the  fact  that  the  possession order made at first instance in this case extended to the whole of Hethfelton, even though the defendants occupied only a part of it. 68. The position is more problematical where a defendant trespasses on part of land, the  rest  of  which  is  physically  occupied  by  a  third  party,  or  even  by  the  landowner. Particular difficulties in this connection are, to my mind, raised in relation to a wide order for  possession  in  a  claim  within  CPR  55.1(b).  Such  “a  claim”  may  be  brought  “for  the recovery of land which the claimant alleges is occupied only by a person or persons who entered  or  remained  on  the  land  without  …  consent  …”.  Given  that  such  a  claim  is limited to “land … occupied only by” trespassers, it is not immediately easy to see how it could  be  brought,  even  in  part,  in  relation  to  land  occupied  by  persons  who  are  not trespassers. And it is fundamental that the court cannot accord a claimant more relief than he seeks (although it is, of course, possible, in appropriate circumstances, for a claimant to amend to increase the extent of his claim, but that is not relevant here). 69. The  Court  of  Appeal  in  University  of  Essex  v  Djemal  [1980]  1  WLR  1301 nonetheless  decided  that  a  University  could  be  granted  a  possession  order  under  RSC Order 113 rule 1, which was (in relation to the issue in this case) in similar terms to CPR 55(1)(b),  in  respect  of  its  whole  campus,  against  trespassers  who  were  squatting  in  a relatively small part, even though the remainder of the campus was lawfully occupied by academics,  other  employees,  and  indeed  students.  This  was  a  thoroughly  practical decision arrived at to deal with a fairly widespread problem at the time, namely student sit-ins. There was an obvious fear that, if an order for possession was limited to the rooms occupied  by  the  student  trepassers,  they  would  simply  move  to  another  part  of  the campus.  70. As already mentioned, given that there is the alternative remedy of self-help, the court should ensure that its procedures are as effective as lawfully possible. Nonetheless, there is obviously great force in the argument that the fact that areas of the campus in that case  was  lawfully  and  exclusively  occupied  by  academic  staff,  employees  and  students  Page 21 \\x0c        should have precluded a claim and an order for possession in respect of those areas, both in principle and in the light of the wording of RSC Order 113 rule 1. 71. However,  this  is  not  the  occasion  formally  to  consider  the  correctness  of  the decision  in  Djemal  [1980]  1  WLR  1301,  which  was  not  put  in  issue  by  either  of  the parties, as the Secretary of State (like the Court of Appeal in Drury [2004] 1 WLR 1906) relied  on  it,  and  the  appellants  were  content  to  distinguish  it.  Accordingly,  the implications of overruling or explaining the decision, which may be far-reaching in terms of principle and practice, have not been debated or canvassed.  72. The  Court  of  Appeal’s  conclusion  in  Drury  [2004]  1  WLR  1906,  that  the  court could make a wider order for possession such as that in the instant case, rested very much on  the  reasoning  in  Djemal  [1980]  1  WLR  1306,  and  in  the  subsequent  first  instance decision of Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food v Heyman 59 P&CR 48, which represented an “incremental development of the ruling in [Djemal [1980] 1 WLR 1306]”, as Mummery LJ put it at [2004] 1 WLR 1906, para 35. However, it seems to me that the decision in Drury [2004] 1 WLR 1906 was an illegitimate extension of the reasoning and decision  in  Djemal  [1980]  1  WLR  1306.  The  fact  that  an  order  for  possession  can  be made in respect of a single piece of land, only part of which is occupied by trespassers, does not justify the conclusion that an order for possession can be made in respect of two entirely separate pieces of land, only one of which is occupied by trespassers, just because both pieces of land happen to be in common ownership. As already mentioned, bailiffs, whether acting on instructions from a landowner exercising the right of self-help to evict a trespasser or acting pursuant to a warrant of possession, can remove the trespasser on part of a piece of property from the whole of that property, but they cannot prevent him from  entering  a  different  property,  possibly  many  miles  away.  Similarly,  while  it  is acceptable,  at  least  in  some  circumstances,  to  treat  occupation  of  part  of  property  as amounting to occupation of the whole of that property, one cannot treat occupation of one property  as  amounting  to  occupation  of  another,  entirely  separate,  property,  possibly miles away, simply because the two properties are in the same ownership.  73. Having said all that, I accept that the notion of a wider, effectively precautionary, order  for  possession  as  made  in  Drury  [2004]  1  WLR  1906  has  obvious  attraction  in practice.  As  the  Court  of  Appeal  explained  in  that  case,  the  alternative  to  a  wider possession order, namely an injunction restraining the defendant from  camping  in  other woods  in  the  area,  would  be  of  limited  efficacy.  An  order  for  possession  is  normally enforced in the County Court by applying for a warrant of possession under CCR Order 26,  which  involves  the  occupiers  being  removed  from  the  land  by  the  bailiffs.  (The equivalent in the High Court is a writ of possession executed by the Sheriff under RSC Order  45  rule  3).  This  is  a  procedurally  direct  and  simple  method  of  enforcement.  An injunction,  however,  “may  be  enforced”,  and  that  was  treated  by  the  court  in  Drury [2004] 1 WLR 1906 as meaning “may only be enforced”, by sequestration or committal – see RSC Order 45 rule 5(1), and, in relation to the County Court, CCR 29 and section 38 of  the  County  Courts  Act  1984.  Given  that  the  claimant’s  aim  is  to  evict  the  travellers, those  are  unsatisfactory  remedies  compared  with  applying  for  a  warrant  of  possession.  Page 22 \\x0c        They  are  not  only  indirect,  but  they  are  normally  procedurally  unwieldy  and  time-consuming, and, in any event, they are of questionable value in cases against travellers, as explained in the next section of this opinion. 74. There  is  also  some  apparent  force  as  a  matter  of  principle  in  the  notion  that  the Courts should be able to grant a precautionary wider order for possession. If judges have developed the concept of an injunction which restrains a defendant from doing something he has not yet done, but is threatening to do, why, it might be asked, should they now not develop  an  order  for  possession  which  requires  a  defendant  to  deliver  up  possession  of land that he has not yet occupied, but is threatening to occupy? The short answer is that a wider or precautionary order for possession, whether in the form granted in this case or in the prescribed Form N26, requires a defendant to do something he cannot do, namely to deliver up possession of land he does not occupy, and purports to return to the claimant something he has not lost, namely possession of land of which already he has possession.  75.  What  the  claimant  is  really  seeking  in  the  present  case  is  an  order  that,  if  the defendant goes onto the other woods, the claimant should be entitled to possession. That is really in the nature of declaratory or injunctive relief: it is not an order for possession. A  declaration  identifies  the  parties’  rights  and  obligations.  A  quia  timet  injunction involves the court forbidding the defendant from doing something which he may do and which he would not entitled to do. Both those types of relief are different from what the Court of Appeal intended to grant here, namely a contingent order requiring the defendant to do something (to deliver up possession) if he does something else (trespassing) which he may do and which he would not be entitled to do. I describe the Court of Appeal as intending to grant such an order, because, as just explained, the actual order is in the form of an immediate order for possession of the other woods, which, as I have mentioned, is also hard to justify, given that the defendants were not in occupation of any part of them. 76. Further, while it would be beneficial to be able to make a wider possession order because of the relative ease with which it could be enforced in the event of the defendants trespassing  on  other  woods,  such  an  order  would  not  be  without  its  disadvantages  and limitations.  An  order  for  possession  only  binds  those  persons  who  are  parties  to  the proceedings (and their privies), although the bailiffs (and sheriffs) are obliged to execute  a  warrant  (or  writ)  of  possession  against  all  those  in  occupation  –  see  In  re  Wykeham Terrace,  Brighton,  Sussex  [1971]  Ch  204,  209-10,  R  v  Wandsworth  County  Court  ex  p Wandsworth  London  Borough  Council  [1975]  1  WLR  1314,  1317-9,  Thompson  v Elmbridge  Borough  Council  [1987]  1  WLR  1425,  1431-2,  and  the  full  discussion  in Wonnacott op cit at pages 146-52. It would therefore be wrong in principle for the court to make a wider order for possession against trespassers (whether named or not) in one wood  with  a  view  to  its  being  executed  against  other  trespassers  in  other  woods. Nonetheless, because the warrant must be executed against anyone on the land, there is either  a  risk  of  one  or  more  of  the  occupiers  of  another  wood  being  evicted  without having the benefit of due process, or room for delay while such an occupier applies to the court and is heard before a warrant is executed against him.   Page 23 \\x0c         77. Quite apart from this, a warrant of possession to execute an order for possession made in the County Court in a claim for possession against trespassers can only be issued without  leave within  three months of the order – CCR Order 24 rule 6(2). So, after the expiry  of  three  months,  a  wider  possession  order  does  not  obviate  the  need  for  the claimant applying to the court before he can obtain possession of any land the subject of the order. Further, as pointed out by Wilson J in Drury [2004] 1 WLR 1906, para 22, it seems  rather  arbitrary  that  only  a  person  who  owns  land  which  is  being  unlawfully occupied  can  obtain  a  wider  order  for  possession  protecting  all  his  land  in  a  particular area. 78. In conclusion on this issue, while there is considerable practical attraction in the notion that the court should be able to make the wide type of possession order which the Court  of  Appeal  made  in  this  case,  following  Drury  [2004]  1  WLR  1906,  I  do  not consider that the court has such power. It is inconsistent with the nature of a possession order, and with the relevant provisions governing the powers of the court. The reasoning in the case on which it is primarily based, Djemal [1980] 1 WLR 1301, cannot sensibly be extended to justify the making of a wider possession order, and there are aspects of such an order which would be unsatisfactory. I should add that I have read what Lord Rodger has to say on this, the main, issue, and I agree with him. Should an injunction be refused as it will probably not be enforced? 79. That  brings  me  to  the  question  whether  an  injunction  restraining  travellers  from trespassing  on  other  land  should  be  granted  in  circumstances  such  as  the  present. Obviously,  the  decision  whether  or  not  to  grant  an  order  restraining  a  person  from trespassing  will  turn  very  much  on  the  precise  facts  of  the  case.  Nonetheless,  where  a trespass to the claimant’s property is threatened, and particularly where a trespass is being committed, and has been committed in the past, by the defendant, an injunction to restrain the threatened trespass would, in the absence of good reasons to the contrary, appear to be appropriate. 80. However,  as  Lord  Walker  said  during  argument,  the  court  should  not  normally make orders which it does not intend, or will be unable, to enforce. In a case such as the present, if the defendants had disobeyed an injunction not to trespass on any of the other woods, it seems highly unlikely that the two methods of enforcement prescribed by CCR 29 and  section  38 of the County Courts Act 1984  (RSC Order  45  rule 5(1) in the High Court)  would  be  invoked.  The  defendants  presumably  have  no  significant  assets  apart from  their  means  of  transport,  which  are  also  their  homes,  so  sequestration  would  be pointless  or  oppressive.  And  many  of  the  defendants  are  vulnerable,  and  most  of  them have young children, so imprisonment may very well be disproportionate. In South Bucks District Council v Porter [2003] UKHL 26, [2003] 2 AC 558, local planning authorities were seeking injunctions to restrain gypsies from remaining on land in breach of planning law, and at para 32, Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that “[t]he court should ordinarily be  Page 24 \\x0c         slow  to  make  an  order  which  it  would  not  …  be  willing,  if  need  be,  to  enforce  by imprisonment”. 81. On the other hand, in the same paragraph of his opinion, Lord Bingham also said that  “[a]pprehension  that  a  party  may  disobey  an  order  should  not  deter  the  court  from making  an  order  otherwise  appropriate”.  A  court  may  consider  it  unlikely  that  it  would make an order for sequestration or imprisonment, if an injunction it was being invited to grant were to be breached, but it may nonetheless properly decide to grant the injunction. Thus, the court may take the view that the defendants are more likely not to trespass on the claimant’s land if an injunction is granted, because of their respect for a court order, or because of their fear of the repercussions of breaching such an order. Or the court may think  that  an  order  of  imprisonment  for  breach,  while  unlikely,  would  nonetheless  be  a real possibility, or it may think that a suspended order of imprisonment, in the event of breach,  may  well  be  a  deterrent  (although  a  suspended  order  should  not  be  made  if  the court does not anticipate activating the order if the terms of suspension are breached).  82. It  was  suggested  in  argument  that,  if  a  defendant  established  an  unauthorised camp in a wood which, in earlier proceedings, he had been enjoined from occupying, the court would be likely to be sympathetic to an application by the Commission to abridge even the short time limits in CPR 55.5.2. However, as Lord Rodger observed, if the court were satisfied that a defendant was moving from unauthorised site to unauthorised site on woods managed by the Commission, an abridgement of time limits might be thought to be appropriate anyway. Quite apart from this, if the only reason for granting an injunction restraining a defendant from trespassing in other woods was to assist the Commission in obtaining possession of any of those other woods should the defendant camp in them, it seems  to  me  that  this  could  be  catered  for  by  declaratory  relief.  For  instance,  the  court could grant a declaration that the Commission is in possession of those other woods and the defendant has no right to dispossess it. 83. In  some  cases,  it  may  be  inappropriate  to  grant  an  injunction  to  restrain  a trespassing  on  land  unless  the  court  considers  not  only  that  there  is  a  real  risk  of  the defendants  so  trespassing,  but  also  that  there  is  at  least  a  real  prospect  of  enforcing  the injunction  if  it  is  breached.  However,  even  where  there  appears  to  be  little  prospect  of enforcing the injunction by imprisonment or sequestration, it may be appropriate to grant it because the judge considers that the grant of an injunction could have a real deterrent effect  on  the  particular  defendants.  If  the  judge  considers  that  some  relief  would  be appropriate only because it could well assist the claimant in obtaining possession of such land if the defendants commit the threatened trespass, then a declaration would appear to me to be more appropriate than an injunction.  84. In the present case, neither the Recorder nor the Court of Appeal appears to have concluded  that  an  injunction  should  be  refused  on  the  ground  that  it  would  not  be enforced by imprisonment or because it would have no real value. Although it may well  Page 25 \\x0c         be that a case could have been (and may well have been) developed along those lines, it was  not  adopted  by  the  Recorder,  and  clearly  did  not  impress  the  Court  of  Appeal.  In those circumstances, it seems to me that it is not appropriate for this Court to set aside the injunction unless satisfied that it was plainly wrong to grant it, or that there was an error of principle in the reasoning which led to its grant. It does not appear to me that either of those points has been established in this case. The effect of the 2004 Guidance on the grant of an injunction 85. The Recorder considered that it was inappropriate to grant an injunction in favour of  the  Secretary  of  State  because  the  Commission  had  not  complied  with  the  2004 Guidance  in  relation  to  the  other  woods  before  issuing  the  proceedings,  and  would  not give  an  assurance  that  it  would  comply  with  the  2004  Guidance  before  it  enforced  the injunction.  The  Court  of  Appeal  considered  that  the  injunction  could  nonetheless  be granted, as the issue of the Commission’s compliance with the 2004 Guidance could be considered before the injunction was enforced. 86. As  I  have  already  mentioned,  it  has  been  conceded  by  the  Secretary  of  State throughout  these  proceedings  that  the  Commission  is  obliged  to  comply  with  the  2004 Guidance,  and  that  failure  to  do  so  may  vitiate  its  right  to  possession  against  travellers trespassing  on  land  it  manages.  On  that  basis,  there  is  some  initial  attraction  in  the appellants’  argument  that,  if  the  2004  Guidance  ought  to  be  complied  with  before  the injunction  is  enforced,  it  would  be  inappropriate  to  grant  the  injunction  before  the Guidance  was  complied  with.  After  all,  now  the  injunction  has  been  granted,  the defendants  would  be  in  contempt  of  court  and  prone  to  imprisonment  (once  the appropriate  procedures  had  been  complied  with)  if  they  encamped  on  any  of  the  other woods. 87. However, I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal was right to conclude that, even in the light of the Secretary of State’s concession, the 2004 Guidance did not present an obstacle to the granting of an injunction in this case. The Guidance is concerned with steps  to  be  taken  in  relation  to  existing  unauthorised  encampments:  it  is  not  concerned with  preventing  such  encampments  from  being  established  in  the  first  place.  The recommended procedures in the 2004 Guidance were relevant to the question of whether an order for possession should be made against the defendants in respect of their existing encampment  on  Hethfelton.  However,  quite  apart  from  the  fact  that  they  are  merely aspects  of  a  non-statutory  code  of  guidance,  those  recommendations  are  not  directly relevant to the issue of whether the defendants should be barred from setting up a camp on other land managed by the Commission. Accordingly, I do not see how it could have justified  an  attack  on  the  lawfulness  of  the  Secretary  of  State  seeking  an  injunction  to restrain the defendants from setting up such unauthorised camps. At least on the basis of the  concession  to  which  I  have  referred,  I  incline  to  the  view  that  the  existence  and provisions  of  the  2004  Guidance  could  be  taken  into  account  by  the  Court  when  Page 26 \\x0c         considering  whether  to  grant  an  injunction  and  when  fashioning  the  terms  of  any injunction. However, I prefer to leave the point open, as it was, understandably, not much discussed in argument before us. 88. Even if the 2004 Guidance was of relevance to the issue of whether the injunction should be granted, it seems to me that it could not be decisive. Otherwise, it would mean that such an injunction could never be granted, because it would not be possible to carry out  up-to-date  welfare  enquiries  in  relation  to  defendants  who  might  not  move  onto  a wood  which  they  were  enjoined  from  occupying  for  several  months,  or,  conceivably, even  several  years,  after  the  order  was  made.  As Arden LJ held, particularly bearing in mind  that  it  purports  to  be  no  more  than  guidance,  the  effect  and  purpose  of  the  2004 Guidance is simply not strong enough to displace the Secretary of State’s right to seek the assistance  of  the  court  to  prevent  a  legal  right  being  infringed.  Further,  the  fact  that welfare  enquiries  were  made  in  relation  to  the  defendants’  occupation  of  Hethfelton  by social  services  means  that  the  more  significant  investigations  required  by  the  2004 Guidance had been carried out anyway.  89. Following  questions  from  Lady  Hale,  it  transpired  for  the  first  time  in  these proceedings that, at the time of the issue of the  claim, the Commission  had (and has) a detailed procedural code which is intended to apply when there are travellers unlawfully on  its  land,  and  that  this  code  substantially  followed  the  2004  Guidance.  It  therefore appears that the Commission has considered the 2004 Guidance and promulgated a code which  takes  its  contents  into  account.  On  that  basis,  unless  it  could  be  shown  in  a particular  case  that  the  code  had  been  ignored,  it  appears  to  me  that  the  Commission’s decision  to  evict  travellers  could  not  be  unlawful  on  the  ground  relied  on  by  the appellants  in  this  case.  However,  it  appears  to  me  that  failure  to  comply  with  non-statutory  guidance  would  be  unlikely  to  render  a  decision  unlawful,  although  failure  to have regard to the guidance could do so.  90. If  the  defendants  were  to  trespass  onto  land  covered  by  the  injunction,  the Commission  would  presumably  comply  with  its  code  before  seeking  to  enforce  the injunction. If it did not do so, then, if justified on the facts of a particular case, there may (at least if the Commission’s concession is correct) be room for argument that, in seeking to  enforce  the  injunction  against  travellers  who  have  set  up  a  camp  in  breach  of  an injunction, the Secretary of State was acting unlawfully. It is true that this means that, in a case such as this, a defendant who trespasses in breach of an injunction may be at risk of imprisonment  before  the  Commission  has  complied  with  the  2004  Guidance.  However, where imprisonment is sought and where it would otherwise be a realistic prospect, the defendant could argue at the committal hearing that the injunction should not be enforced, even  that  it  should  be  discharged,  on  the  ground  that  the  recommendations  in  the  2004 Guidance have not been followed.  Page 27 \\x0c         91. Accordingly, on this point, I conclude that, even assuming (in accordance with the Secretary of State’s concession) that the Commission’s failure to comply with the 2004 Guidance may deter the court from making an order for possession against travellers, it should not preclude the granting of an injunction to restrain travellers from trespassing on other land. However, at least in a case where it could be shown that the claimant should have considered the 2004 Guidance, but did not do so, the Guidance could conceivably be relevant  to  the  question  whether  an  injunction  should  be  granted  (and  if  so  on  what terms), and, if the injunction is breached, to the question of whether or not it should be enforced  (and,  if  so,  how).  In  the  event,  therefore,  the  grant  of  an  injunction  was appropriate  as  Arden  and  Pill  LJ  concluded  (and  the  only  reason  Wilson  LJ  thought otherwise, namely the existence of the wider possession order, no longer applies). The implications of this analysis 92. As I have explained, the thinking of the Court of Appeal in Drury [2004] 1 WLR 1906 proceeded on the basis that an injunction restraining trespass to land could only be enforced by sequestration or imprisonment. In the light of the terms of RSC Order 45 rule 5(1), this may very well be right. Certainly, in the light of the contrast between the terms of  that  rule  and  the  terms  of  RSC  Order  45  rule  3(1)  and  CCR  26  rule  16(1)  (which respectively  provide  for  writs  and  warrants  of  possession  only  to  enforce  orders  for possession), it is hard to see how a warrant of possession in the County Court or a writ of possession in the High Court could be sought by a claimant, where such an injunction was breached. 93. However, where, after the grant of such an injunction (or, indeed, a declaration), a defendant entered onto the land in question, it is, I think, conceivable that, at least in the High  Court,  the  claimant  could  apply  for  a  writ  of  restitution,  ordering  the  sheriff  or bailiffs  to  recover  possession  of  the  land  for  the  benefit  of  the  claimant.  Such  a  writ  is often described as one of the “writs in aid of” other writs, such as a writ of possession or a writ of delivery –see for instance RSC Order 46 rule 1. Restitution is normally the means of  obtaining  possession  against  a  defendant  (or  his  privy)  who  has  gone  back  into possession after having been evicted pursuant to a court order. It appears that it can also be  invoked  against  a  claimant  who  has  obtained  possession  pursuant  to  a  court  order which is subsequently set aside (normally on  appeal) – see sc46.3.3 in Civil Procedure, Vol 1, 2009. Historically at any rate, a writ of restitution could also be sought against a person who had gone into possession by force: see Cole on Ejectment (1857) pp 692-4. So  there  may  be  an  argument  that  such  a  writ  may  be  sought  by  a  claimant  against  a defendant who has entered onto the land after an injunction has been granted restraining him from doing so, or even after a declaration has been made that the claimant is, and the defendant  is  not,  entitled  to  possession.  It  may  also  be  the  case  that  it  is  open  to  the County Court to issue a warrant of restitution in such circumstances.  Page 28 \\x0c           94.  Whether  a  writ  or  warrant  of  restitution  would  be  available  to  support  such  an injunction  or  declaration,  and  whether  the  present  procedural  rules  governing  the enforcement of injunctions against trespass on facts such as those in the present case are satisfactory,  seem  to  me  to  be  questions  which  are  ripe  for  consideration  by  the  Civil Procedure  Rules  Committee.  The  precise  ambit  of  the  circumstances  in  which  a  writ  or warrant of restitution may be sought is somewhat obscure, and could usefully be clarified. Further,  if,  as  I  have  concluded,  it  is  not  open  to  the  court  to  grant  a  wider  order  for possession, as was granted by the Court of Appeal in Drury [2004] 1 WLR 1906 and in this  case,  then  it  appears  likely  that  there  may  very  well  be  defects  in  the  procedural powers of the courts of England and Wales. Where a person threatens to trespass on land, an  injunction  may  well  be  of  rather  little,  if  any,  real  practical  value  if  the  person  is someone against whom an order for sequestration or imprisonment is unlikely to be made, and an order for possession is not one which is open to the court. In addition, it seems to me  that  it  may  be  worth  considering  whether  the  current  court  rules  satisfactorily  deal with circumstances such as those which were considered in Djemal [1980] 1WLR 1306.  95. Accordingly, it follows that, for my part, I would allow the defendants’ appeal to the extent of setting aside the wider possession order made by the Court of Appeal, but dismiss  their  appeal  to  the  extent  of  upholding  the  injunction  granted  by  the  Court  of Appeal.  Disposal of this appeal LORD COLLINS 96. At the end of the argument my inclination was to the conclusion that in Secretary of  State  for  the  Environment,  Food  and  Rural  Affairs  v  Drury  [2004]  EWCA  Civ  200, [2004] 1 WLR 1906 the Court of Appeal had legitimately extended University of Essex v Djemal [1980] 1 WLR 1301 to fashion an exceptional remedy to deal with cases of the present  kind.  I  was  particularly  impressed  by  the  point  that  an  injunction  might  be  a remedy which was not capable of being employed effectively in cases such as this. But I am now convinced that there is no legitimate basis for making an order for possession in an  action  for  the  recovery  of  wholly  distinct  land  of  which  the  defendant  is  not  in possession.   97. But in my opinion University of Essex v Djemal [1980] 1 WLR 1301 represented a sensible and practical solution to the problem faced by the University, and was correctly decided.  I  agree,  in  particular,  that  it  can  be  justified  on  the  basis  that  the  University’s right to possession of its campus was indivisible, as Lord Rodger says, or that the remedy  Page 29 \\x0cis available to a person whose possession or occupation has been interfered with, as Lady Hale puts it. Where the defendant is occupying part of the claimant’s premises, the order for  possession  may  extend  to  the  whole  of  the  premises.  First,  it  has  been  pointed  out, rightly,  that  the  courts  have  used  the  concept  of  possession  in  differing  contexts  as  a functional and relative concept in order to do justice and to effectuate the social purpose of  the  legal  rules  in  which  possession  (or,  I  would  add,  deprivation  of  possession)  is  a necessary element: Harris, The Concept of Possession in English Law, in Oxford Essays in Jurisprudence (ed Guest, 1961) 69 at 72.  Secondly, the procedural powers of the court are subject to incremental change in order to adapt to the new circumstances: see, e.g. in relation  to  the  power  to  grant  injunctions,  Fourie  v  Le  Roux  [2007]  UKHK  1  [2007]  1 WLR  320,  at  [30];  Masri  v  Consolidated  Contractors  International  (UK)  Ltd  (No.2) [2008] EWCA Civ 303, [2009] 2 WLR 621, at [182]. I  would  therefore  allow  the  appeal  to  the  extent  of  setting  aside  the  wider 98. possession order.

The  Secretary  of  State  sought  an  order  for  possession  in  respect  of  Hethfelton  and  other  specified woods (also managed by the Commission and owned by the Secretary of State) which had not yet been occupied by the defendants to the claim.  The Secretary of State also sought an injunction against the same defendants restraining them from re-entering Hethfelton and from entering the other woods.    The  Recorder  before  whom  the  claim  came  decided  to  grant  an  order  for  possession  against  the defendants in respect of Hethfelton, but not in respect of the other woods.  The Recorder also refused to grant the injunction sought.  The Court of Appeal allowed the Secretary of State’s appeal against the Recorder’s  refusal  to  grant  the  order  for  possession  in  relation  to  the  other  woods  and  against  his refusal to grant the injunction.  The defendants appealed.', 'Judgment': 'The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the defendants’ appeal to the extent of setting aside the wider possession order made by the Court of Appeal.', 'Reasons for the judgment': '\\uf0b7  Two main questions were before the Supreme Court: (1)  Whether  a  court  could  grant  an  order  for  possession  in  respect  of  distinct  land  not  yet (2)  Whether a court should grant an injunction restraining a defendant from trespassing on other occupied or possessed by a defendant. land not currently occupied by him. \\uf0b7  On  the  first  main  question,  the  Supreme  Court  unanimously  agreed  that  a  court  could  not make such an order.  Lord Rodger considered that such an order would be inconsistent with the fundamental nature of an action for recovering land because there was nothing to recover (Para 12).  Lord Neuberger, who agreed with Lord Rodger on this question, thought that it did The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.gov.uk   \\x0cnot make sense to talk about a defendant being required to deliver up possession of land where the  defendant  did  not  occupy  such  land  in  any  conceivable  way,  and  the  claimant  enjoyed uninterrupted possession of it (Paras 64, 74 and 78).  Lords Rodger, Walker, Neuberger and Collins all thought that the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs v Drury [2004] 1 W.L.R. 1906 had illegitimately extended the circumstances in which an order for possession could be made (Paras 5, 20, 72 and 96).  Lady Hale’s main objection to extending  an  order  for  possession  in  respect  of  distinct  land  which  had  not  actually  been intruded upon was one of natural justice.  According to Lady Hale, the main problem with the current  form  of  the  usual  order  was  that  it  was  not  specifically  tailored  against  known individuals who had already intruded upon the claimant’s land, were threatening to do so again, and had been given a proper opportunity to contest the order (Paras 38 and 40).   \\uf0b7  On the second main question, Lord Rodger, Lady Hale and Lord Neuberger agreed that the majority in the Court of Appeal were right to grant an injunction in this case.  Lord Neuberger, with  whom  Lord  Rodger  agreed  on  this  question,  noted  that  neither  the  Recorder  nor  the Court  of  Appeal  had  concluded  that  an  injunction  should  be  refused  on  the  ground  that  it would  not  be  enforced  by  imprisonment  (because  the  defendants  were  vulnerable  or  had young children) or because it would have no real value (since travellers usually have few assets).  The Court of Appeal had not erred in granting the injunction (Para 84).  Lord Neuberger was also  of  the  view  that  the  failure  by  the  Commission  to  comply  with  the  “Guidance  on Managing Unauthorised Camping” issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should not preclude the granting of an injunction to restrain travellers from trespassing on other land (Paras 87 and 91).  Lady Hale thought that the more natural remedy to deal with separate land which had not yet been intruded upon was an injunction against that intrusion, and one should not be unduly hesitant in granting that (Para 39).

So  much  depends  upon  how  one  frames  the  question.  Put  simply,  when disputes arise about the age of some-one who is asking a local children’s services authority to provide him with accommodation under section 20(1) of the Children Act  1989,  who  decides  whether  he  is  a  child  or  not?  Section  20(1)  reads  as follows:   “(1) Every local authority shall provide accommodation for any child in  need  within  their  area  who  appears  to  them  to  require accommodation as a result of –   (a) there being no person who has parental responsibility for him;  (b) his being lost or having been abandoned; or  (c) the person who has been caring for him being prevented (whether or  not  permanently,  and  for  whatever  reason)  from  providing  him with suitable accommodation or care.”   By  section  105(1)  of  the  Act,  a  “‘child’  means  .  .  .  a  person  under  the  age  of eighteen”.   2. The appellants, supported by the Children’s Commissioner for England, say that, in cases of dispute, the court must decide whether a person is a child on the balance of probabilities. The respondent local authorities, supported by the Home Secretary,  say  that  the  authority  must  decide  the  matter,  subject  only  to  judicial review on the usual principles of fairness and rationality.   The importance of the issue   3. No  doubt  there  have  always  been  foundlings,  abandoned  or  runaway children  whose  age  was  not  immediately  apparent  to  the  authorities.  But  with many  of  these  it  will  at  least  have  been  apparent  that  they  were  children.  And sooner  or  later  it  will  usually  have  been  possible  to  establish  their  exact  age  by discovering  their  identity  and  obtaining  a  birth  certificate.  The  problem  of determining age has come to prominence with the recent increase in migration and particularly in unaccompanied young people coming to this country, some of them  Page 2 \\x0c     to claim asylum for their own benefit but some of them also having been trafficked here  for  the  benefit  of  others.  Although  the  focus  of  debate  has  been  upon unaccompanied asylum seeking children, we must not lose sight of the other young people for whom the issue may also be important.   4. The  importance  comes  from  two  directions.  If  a  young  person  is  a  child, and  otherwise  meets  the  qualifying  criteria,  he  must  be  provided  with accommodation and maintenance under sections 20(1) and 23(1) of the 1989 Act. This  brings  with  it  a  wider  range  of  services  than  other  forms  of  housing  and benefit  provision.  These  include  the  services  for  young  people  who  leave  social services  accommodation  which  were  described  in  R  (M)  v  Hammersmith  and Fulham London Borough Council [2008] UKHL 14, [2008] 1 WLR 535, paras 20 – 24. While once upon a time young people may have resisted the quasi-parental services provided for children in need, many now recognise that they bring distinct advantages  over  the  housing  and  welfare  benefits  available  to  “home”  claimants (as in R (M) v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council, above, and R (G) v  Lambeth London Borough Council [2009] UKHL 26, [2009] 1 WLR 1299) and  the  National  Asylum  Support  Service (“NASS”)  support  available  to  asylum seekers, as in the cases before us.      5. The  Home  Secretary  also  adopts  different  policies  in  relation  to  asylum seekers  who  are  under  eighteen.  Legally,  these  may  not  be  relevant  to  the  issue which  we  have  to  determine,  and  in  practice  they  are  much  more  susceptible  to change than is primary legislation such as the 1989 Act. But they are an important part  of  the  factual  background.  Not  only  are  unaccompanied  asylum  seeking children  looked  after  by  the  local  children’s  services  authorities  rather  than  by NASS  while  their  claims  are  decided.  Currently,  if  a  claim  is  rejected  when  the child is under the age of seventeen and a half, the Home Secretary will not remove him  for  three  years  or  until  he  reaches  seventeen  and  a  half,  whichever  is  the earlier, unless there are adequate arrangements to look after him in his country of origin.  Also,  such  children  will  not  be  detained  under  the  Home  Secretary’s immigration  powers,  save  in  exceptional  circumstances  and  then  normally  only overnight.   6.  When a young person who says that he is a child arrives in this country or makes a claim for asylum, immigration officers make a preliminary determination based  upon  his  physical  appearance  and  demeanour.  In  a  borderline  case,  the policy is to give him the benefit of the doubt and treat him as a child. Under the Secretary  of  State’s  2007  Policy  on  Age  Dispute  cases,  if  his  appearance  or demeanour  “very  strongly”  suggests  that  he  is  aged  eighteen  or  over,  the  officer will dispute the age unless there is credible documentary or other evidence to show the age claimed. And if his appearance or demeanour “very strongly” suggest that he  is  “significantly”  over  eighteen  then  he  will  be  treated  as  an  adult.  In  the  Page 3 \\x0c     middle, age disputed, category, it is the policy to refer the case for assessment by the local social services authority and to accept that assessment if it is considered to  have  been  properly  carried  out  (in  accordance  with  the  procedural  guidance given  by  Stanley  Burnton  J  in  R  (B)  v  Merton  London  Borough  Council  [2003] EWHC 1689 (Admin), [2003] 4 All ER 280).   7. This was the policy adopted by the Home Secretary in August 2007. But in February  2007  the  Home  Office  published  a  consultation  paper,  Planning  Better Outcomes  and  Support  for  Unaccompanied  Asylum  Seeking  Children;  and  in January  2008,  it  published  its  conclusions  and  recommendations  in  Better Outcomes:  The  Way  Forward,  Improving  the  Care  of  Unaccompanied  Asylum Seeking Children. Key Reform Number 4 was to put in place better procedures to assess  age,  in  order  to  ensure  that  children  and  adults  are  not  accommodated together.  Both  the  Children’s  Commissioner  and  the  Refugee  Council  have  been critical  of  the  present  procedures,  based  partly  upon  their  own  experience  and observations and partly upon research conducted by Professor Heaven Crawley for the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association.   8. As  Ms  Nathalie  Lieven  QC  for  the  Home  Secretary  points  out,  the  issue before us is not whether the policy and procedures for assessing age in these cases could  be  improved,  but  whether  the  law  requires  that,  in  cases  which  cannot  be resolved  through  those  processes,  the  court  shall  make  the  final  determination. However,  the  one  thing  which  these  proposals  do  show  is  that  the  assessment  of age can be and is carried out quite separately from the assessment of need and the other criteria for accommodation under section 20.     These two cases   9. A  arrived  in  this  country  from  Afghanistan  on  13  November  2007  and claimed asylum the following day, stating that his date of birth was 8 April 1992 (making him then fifteen and a half). The immigration officer considered that he was  eighteen  and  referred  him  to  Croydon  for  an  age  assessment.  He  was interviewed by two social workers who assessed him as an adult. He was therefore referred  to  NASS.  Soon  afterwards  his  solicitors  produced  a  copy  of  a  birth certificate from Afghanistan showing his date of birth as 8 April 1992. They also arranged  for  him  to  be  examined  by  a  paediatrician,  who  reported  that  in  her opinion  he  was  aged  between  15  and  17.  A  claim  for  judicial  review  of  the decision that he was not entitled to accommodation under section 20 of the 1989 Act was made on 7 March 2008 and an interim order made against the authority until the determination of the claim.    Page 4 \\x0c     10.  M arrived in this country in November 2006 and claimed asylum three days later, saying that he was born on 15 December 1989 (making him then just under seventeen).  His  age  was  disputed  and  he  was  referred  to  Lambeth  for  an  age assessment by two social workers who concluded that he was over eighteen. Once again,  a  paediatrician’s  report  was  obtained  which  concluded  that  he  was  indeed aged seventeen. Judicial review proceedings were brought and Lambeth reviewed its  decision  but  provided  further  reasons  for  concluding  that  M  was  more  than twenty  years  old.    Meanwhile  an  immigration  judge  heard  his  appeal  against  the refusal of asylum and the Home Secretary’s decision as to his age. The judge was not  referred  to  the  local  authority’s  assessment  and  accepted  the  paediatrician’s report.  The  Home  Secretary  therefore  granted  M  discretionary  leave  to  remain which  has  been  extended  pending  the  determination  of  his  application  for  an extension of his leave.    11. These  two  and  five  other  claims  for  judicial  review  were  joined  for  the purpose of deciding a number of preliminary issues, with these two being treated as  the  lead  cases.  Those  issues  were  (a)  whether  the  local  authorities’ determinations were contrary to the procedural protections in article 6 and/or 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights; (b) whether the question of “child or not” for the purpose of section 20 of the 1989 Act was one of precedent fact for the court to determine on the balance of probabilities; and (c) whether in M’s case the local authority could disagree with the immigration judge’s decision.    12.  On 20 June 2008, Bennett J decided all three issues in favour of the local authorities:  [2008]  EWHC  1364  (Admin).  He  also  declined  to  decide  a  fourth issue,  as  to  the  evidential  value  of  paediatricians’  reports  in  age  disputes.  That issue has since been determined by Collins J in R (A) v Croydon London Borough Council;  R  (WK)  v  Kent  County  Council  [2009]  EWHC  939  (Admin),  the  Kent case taking the place of the Lambeth case as lead case in this issue. Collins J held that the paediatricians’ views should be taken into account but that they were not likely to be any more reliable or helpful than those of experienced social workers and the authorities were entitled to prefer the latter. He was, of course, bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal as to the role of the courts in these cases.   13.  On 18 December 2008, the Court of Appeal had dismissed the appellants’ appeals  from  the  decisions  of  Bennett  J  on  the  preliminary  issues  of  law:  [2008] EWCA Civ 1445, [2009] PTSR 1011. The issues have been slightly reformulated for the purpose of the appeals before us, but the first two are closely inter-related:   (i)  whether,  as  a  matter  of  statutory  construction,  the  duty  imposed by section 20(1) is owed only to a person who appears to the local authority  to  be  a  child,  so  that  the  authority’s  decision  can  only  be  Page 5 \\x0c     challenged on “Wednesbury” principles, or whether it is owed to any person  who  is  in  fact  a  child,  so  that  the  court  may  determine  the issue on the balance of probabilities;  (ii) whether the issue “child or not” is a question of “precedent” or “jurisdictional”  fact  to  be  decided  by  a  court  on  the  balance  of probabilities; and  (iii) whether section 20(1) gives rise to a “civil right” for the purpose of article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights and if so  whether  the  determination  of  age  by  social  workers  subject  to judicial  review  on  “Wednesbury”  principles  is  sufficient  to  comply with the requirement that the matter be determined by a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal.   The construction of section 20(1)   14. The argument on construction, advanced by Mr John Howell QC for A, is quite straightforward. The words of section 20(1) themselves distinguish between the  statement  of  objective  fact  –  “any  child  in  need  within  their  area”  –  and  the descriptive judgment – “who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of” the three listed circumstances – which is clearly left to the local authority. The definition of “child” in section 105(1), which applies throughout the 1989 Act, is unqualified: “a person under the age of eighteen” – not “a person who appears to the local authority to be under the age of eighteen” or “a person whom the local authority or any other person making the initial decision reasonably believes to be under the age of eighteen”.  Reaching the conclusion that this is what it means in section  20(1)  requires,  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  accepted,  words  to  be  read  into section 20 which are not there.   15. This  argument  is  bolstered  by  two  others.  One  is  derived  from  the legislative history. Section 20(1) of the 1989 Act is the successor to section 2 of the Child Care Act 1980 which consolidated (without amendment) what had been section  1  of  the  Children  Act  1948  with  later  legislation.  The  1948  Act  was  an important component of the establishment of the post-war welfare state, bringing together all the disparate powers and duties of the state to look after children who had  no  families  or  whose  families  were  unable  to  look  after  them  properly,  and infusing those new duties with a commitment to the welfare of the individual child which had been so lacking before (see Report of the Care of Children Committee, Chairman: Miss Myra Curtis, 1946, Cmd 6922).    Page 6 \\x0c     16.  Section 1(1) of the 1948 Act, reproduced in section 2(1) of the 1980 Act, began  “Where  it  appears  to  a  local  authority  with  respect  to  a  child  in  their  area appearing to them to be under the age of seventeen . . .”. Section 20(1) of the 1989 Act made various changes. These included raising the age of eligibility to cater for all  children,  not  just  those  who  appeared  to  be  under  seventeen.  But  they  also included  the  change  in  wording,  which  no  longer  limited  the  duty  to  those  who appeared to the local authority to be under the relevant age. There is nothing in the Review of Child Care Law: Report to Ministers of an Interdepartmental Working Party  (DHSS,  1985)  or  in  the  white  paper,  The  Law  on  Child  Care  and  Family Services (1987, Cm 62), which preceded the 1989 Act to cast light on the reasons for the change in wording. But when Parliamentary draftsmen make changes such as  this  they  are  normally  presumed  to  have  done  so  deliberately  and  not  by mistake.   17. The  second  point  is  that  the  same  definition  of  “child” applies  throughout the  1989  Act.  The  1989  Act  contains  a  variety  of  powers  and  duties  relating  to children, some of them voluntary, but many of them coercive as against the child or his parents. Most of the coercive powers, to make orders relating to the care and upbringing of children, depend upon court orders. Clearly, in those cases it is for the court to determine any disputes about the age of the child. But there are some coercive  powers  which  are  operated  in  the  first  instance  by  other  authorities, subject to bringing the case to court within a relatively short time.    18.  One of these is the power of the police, in section 46, “where a constable has  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  a  child  would  otherwise  be  likely  to  suffer significant  harm”  to  remove  a  child  to  suitable  accommodation  and  keep  him there.  This  power  is  not  infrequently  used  to  pick  up  young  people  who  are camping out in railway stations with no apparent place to go. If someone who was not  a  child  was  removed  in  this  way,  he  could  apply  immediately  for  habeas corpus  and  the  court  would  have  to  inquire  into  whether  or  not  he  was  indeed  a child. The section does not refer to a “person whom the constable has reasonable cause to believe to be a child” and where liberty is at stake the court would be slow to read it in that way.   19.  A  similar  case  is  perhaps  more  telling  for  our  purposes  because  it  is contained in section 25, which, like section 20, appears in Part III of the 1989 Act, entitled “Local Authority Support for Children and Families”. Section 25, and the regulations made under it, place limits on the circumstances in which “a child who is  being  looked  after  by  a  local  authority”  may  be  placed  in  “accommodation provided for the purpose of restricting liberty”. A child who is being “looked after” by a local authority means any child who is subject to a care order or a child who is  provided  with  accommodation  by  a  local  authority  under  their  social  services functions,  which  include  section  20(1)  (see  1989  Act,  section  22(1)).  The  Page 7 \\x0c     regulations  allow  a  child  to  be  placed  in  secure  accommodation  –  that  is,  to  be locked up – for up to 72 hours without the authority of a court (Children (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 1991, SI 1991/1505, reg 10(1)). Again, if a person who was not a child was locked up in this way, he could apply for habeas corpus and the court would have to enquire into whether or not he was a child. There is nothing to suggest that the power can be exercised in relation to someone whom the authority reasonably believes to be a child.   20.  Against these arguments, the respondents make three main points. The first is  that  section  20(1)  refers  to  a  “child  in  need”.  Section  105(7)  provides  that references  to  a  child  in  need  shall  be  construed  in  accordance  with  section  17. Section 17(10) provides that:   “For the purposes of this Part a child shall be taken to be in need if –  (a) he is unlikely to achieve or maintain, or to have the opportunity of  achieving  or  maintaining,  a  reasonable  standard  of  health  or development  without  the  provision  for  him  of  services  by  a  local authority under this Part;  (b)  his  health  or  development  is  likely  to  be  significantly  impaired, or further impaired, without the provision for him of such services; or  (c) he is disabled, . . . ”   Thus, argues Mr Charles Béar QC for Lambeth, it cannot have been the intention of  Parliament  that  the  sorts  of  professional  value  judgment  involved  in  assessing whether  a  child  is  “in  need”  should  be  made  by  the  court.  “Child  in  need”  is  a composite  term  of  art  so  that  the  same  should  apply  to  the  assessment  of  age  as well as need.    21. This argument is closely allied to a second and more fundamental argument about  the  respective  roles  of  public  authorities  and  the  courts  when  determining whether  the  conditions  exist  for  the  exercise  of  a  statutory  power  or  duty.  The court decides what the words mean and the authority decides whether the facts fit those  words.  Thus,  in  the  well-known  case  of  R  v  Barnet  London  Borough Council,  Ex  p  Shah  [1983]  2  AC  309,  the  court  decided  what  was  meant  by “ordinarily resident” in the criteria for entitlement to a mandatory education grant  Page 8 \\x0c     and sent the case back to the local authority to decide. Lord Scarman said this, at p 341:   “If a local education authority gets the law right, or, as the lawyers would put it, directs itself correctly in law, the question of fact – ie has  the  student  established  the  prescribed  residence?  –  is  for  the authority, not the court, to decide. The merits of the application are for  the  local  education  authority  subject  only  to  judicial  review  to ensure that the authority has proceeded according to the law.”   22. To  similar  effect  were  the  observations  of  Lord  Brightman  in  R  v Hillingdon  London  Borough  Council,  Ex  p  Puhlhofer  [1986]  AC  484,  where  the court  decided  whether  the  Housing  (Homeless  Persons)  Act  1977  imported  any requirement that the accommodation currently occupied by a household claiming to be homeless be accommodation which it was reasonable for them to continue to occupy.  Having  decided  that  it  did  not,  Lord  Brightman  insisted,  at  p  517,  that “What  is  properly  to  be  regarded  as  accommodation  is  a  question  of  fact  to  be decided by the local authority”.    23. Third  in  the  line  of  cases  cited  on  this  point  were  my  own  words  in  R (Wahid) v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council [2002] LGR 545, 554, which are  particularly  pertinent  because  they  relate  to  the  duty  of  local  social  services authorities, under section 21(1)(a) of the National Assistance Act 1948, to provide residential  accommodation  for  vulnerable  adults  who  meet  the  criteria  there  laid down:  “it  is  for  the  local  social  services  authority  to  assess  whether  or  not  those conditions are fulfilled, and if so, how the need is to be met, subject to the scrutiny of the courts on the ordinary principles of judicial review”.   24.  We are not deciding where the lines of responsibility are to be drawn under the National Assistance Act 1948. We are deciding where Parliament intended that the lines be drawn under the Children Act 1989. The task in all these cases is to decide  what  Parliament  intended.  In  the  Shah  case,  it  was  common  ground between  the  parties  on  all  sides  that  it  was  for  the  local  education  authority  to decide the facts. No-one mounted an argument such as has been mounted in this case. We do not need to decide how it would have fared in 1983, any more than we need  to  speculate  upon  how  it  might  be  decided  now.  In  the  Puhlhofer  case,  the statutory  duty  to  provide  accommodation for the homeless was clearly expressed in terms that the local authority was satisfied that the criteria existed, as indeed is its  successor  today.  Lord  Brightman  emphasised,  at  p  518,  that  the  1977  Act “abounds  with  the  formula  when,  or  if,  the  housing  authority  are  satisfied  as  to this,  or  that,  or  have  reason  to  believe  this,  or  that”  in  support  of  his  conclusion that “Parliament intended the local authority to be the judge of fact”.    Page 9 \\x0c       25. That is not the case with the National Assistance Act 1948, which has gone through several modifications since it was first enacted, when the duty of the local authority  was  to  prepare  a  scheme  for  accommodating  the  vulnerable  which  had then  to  be  approved  by  the  minister.  It  is  not  impossible  that  Parliament  did  not contemplate that such a duty would be owed to any particular individual, whereas this  House  has  clearly  held,  in  R  (G)  v  Barnet  London  Borough  Council  [2003] UKHL 57, [2004] 2 AC 208, that the duty in section 20(1) of the 1989 Act is owed to the individual child.   26. These days, Parliamentary draftsmen are more alive to this kind of debate. The  1989  Act  draws  a  clear  and  sensible  distinction  between  different  kinds  of question. The question whether a child is “in need” requires a number of different value judgments. What would be a reasonable standard of health or development for this particular child? How likely is he to achieve it? What services might bring that standard up to a reasonable level? What amounts to a significant impairment of  health  or  development?  How  likely  is  that?  What  services  might  avoid  it? Questions  like  this  are  sometimes  decided  by  the  courts  in  the  course  of  care  or other proceedings under the Act. Courts are quite used to deciding them upon the evidence  for  the  purpose  of  deciding  what  order,  if  any,  to  make.  But  where  the issue is not, what order should the court make, but what service should the local authority provide, it is entirely reasonable to assume that Parliament intended such evaluative  questions  to  be  determined  by  the  public  authority,  subject  to  the control of the courts on the ordinary principles of judicial review. Within the limits of  fair  process  and  “Wednesbury  reasonableness”  there  are  no  clear  cut  right  or wrong answers.   27.  But  the  question  whether  a  person  is  a  “child”  is  a  different  kind  of question. There is a right or a wrong answer. It may be difficult to determine what that answer is. The decision-makers may have to do their best on the basis of less than  perfect  or  conclusive  evidence.  But  that  is  true  of  many  questions  of  fact which  regularly  come  before  the  courts.  That  does  not  prevent  them  from  being questions for the courts rather than for other kinds of decision makers.   28. The  arguments  advanced  by  Mr  Béar  might  have  to  provide  an  answer  in cases where Parliament has not made its intentions plain. But in this case it appears to  me  that  Parliament  has  done  just  that.  In  section  20(1)  a  clear  distinction  is drawn between the question whether there is a “child in need within their area” and the  question  whether  it  appears  to  the  local  authority  that  the  child  requires accommodation for one of the listed reasons. In section 17(10) a clear distinction is drawn  between  whether  the  person  is  a  “child”  and  whether  that  child  is  to  be “taken  to  be”  in  need  within  the  meaning  of  the  Act.  “Taken  to  be”  imports  an  Page 10 \\x0c     element of judgment, even an element of deeming in the case of a disabled child, which  Parliament  may  well  have  intended  to  be  left  to  the  local  authority  rather than the courts.   29. I  reach  those  conclusions  on  the  wording  of  the  1989  Act  and  without recourse to the additional argument, advanced by Mr Timothy Straker QC for M, that “child” is a question of jurisdictional or precedent fact of which the ultimate arbiters  are  the  courts  rather  than  the  public  authorities  involved.  This  doctrine does,  as  Ward  LJ  pointed  out  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  1445, [2009]  PTSR  1011,  para  19,  have  “an  ancient  and  respectable  pedigree”. Historically,  like  the  remedy  of  certiorari  itself,  it  was  applied  to  inferior  courts and  other  judicial  or  quasi-judicial  bodies  with  limited  jurisdiction.  Thus  a  tithe commissioner could not give himself jurisdiction over land which had previously been discharged from tithe (Bunbury v Fuller (1853) 9 Ex 111); and a rent tribunal could  not  give  itself  jurisdiction  over  an  unfurnished  letting  (R  v  Fulham, Hammersmith  and  Kensington  Rent  Tribunal,  Ex  p  Zerek  [1951]  2  KB  1). Although  of  course  such  a  body  would  have  to  inquire  into  the  facts  in  order  to decide  whether  or  not  to  take  the  case,  if  it  got  the  decision  wrong,  it  could  not give itself a jurisdiction which it did not have.   30. In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Khawaja [1984] AC 74, the same principle was applied to the power of the Home Office to remove an  “illegal  entrant”.  The  existence  of  the  power  of  removal  depended  upon  that fact.  It  was  not  enough  that  an  immigration  officer  had  reasonable  grounds  for believing the person to be an illegal entrant. As Lord Scarman put it, “. . . where the  exercise  of  executive  power  depends  upon  the  precedent  establishment  of  an objective fact, the courts will decide whether the requirement has been satisfied” (p 110).   31. This  doctrine  is  not  of  recent  origin  or  limited  to  powers  relating  to  the liberty  of  the  subject.  But  of  course  it  still  requires  us  to  decide which questions are  to  be  regarded  as  setting  the  limits  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  public  authority and which questions simply relate to the exercise of that jurisdiction. This too must be  a  question  of  statutory  construction,  although  Wade  and  Forsyth  on Administrative  Law  suggest  that  “As  a  general  rule,  limiting  conditions  stated  in objective terms will be treated as jurisdictional” (9th ed (2004), p 257). It was for this  reason  that  Ward  LJ  rejected  the  argument,  for  he  regarded  the  threshold question in section 20 as the composite one of whether the person was a “child in need”. This was not a limiting condition stated in wholly objective terms so as to satisfy the Wade and Forsyth test (para 25).    Page 11 \\x0c     32.  However, as already explained, the Act does draw a distinction between a “child” and a “child in need” and even does so in terms which suggest that they are two different kinds of question. The word “child” is undoubtedly defined in wholly objective terms (however hard it may be to decide upon the facts of the particular case).  With  a  few  limited  extensions,  it  defines  the  outer  boundaries  of  the jurisdiction of both courts and local authorities under the 1989 Act. This is an Act for and about children. If ever there were a jurisdictional fact, it might be thought, this is it.   33. The final arguments raised against such a conclusion are of a practical kind. The  only  remedy  available  is  judicial  review  and  this  is  not  well  suited  to  the determination of disputed questions of fact. This is true but it can be so adapted if the need arises: see R (Wilkinson) v Broadmoor Special Hospital Authority [2001] EWCA Civ 1545, [2002] 1 WLR 419. That the remedy is judicial review does not dictate the issue for the court to decide or the way in which it should do so, as the cases  on  jurisdictional  fact  illustrate.  Clearly,  as  those  cases  also  illustrate,  the public  authority,  whether  the  children’s  services  authority  or  the  UK  Border Agency, has to make its own determination in the first instance and it is only if this remains disputed that the court may have to intervene. But the better the quality of the  initial  decision-making,  the  less  likely  it  is  that  the  court  will  come  to  any different decision upon the evidence. If the other members of the Court agree with my  approach  to  the  determination  of  age,  it  does  not  mean  that  all  the  other judgments involved in the decision whether or not to provide services to children or  to  other  client  groups  must  be  subject  to  determination  by  the  courts.  They remain governed by conventional principles.   Article 6    34.  Those  conclusions  make  it  unnecessary  to  reach  any  firm  conclusions  on the application of article 6 of the Convention to decisions under section 20(1) of the 1989 Act. Article 6(1) requires that “in the determination of his civil rights and obligations . . . everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.” There are two questions.  First,  is  the  decision  whether  or  not  to  provide  accommodation  under section  20(1)  the  determination  of  a  “civil  right”,  so  that  article  6  is  engaged? Secondly, if it is, what does article 6 require? Neither question is easy to answer.   35. First, it seems to me clear that, once the qualifying criteria are established, the local authority has no discretion under section 20(1): the accommodation must be provided. The existence of the criteria is a matter of judgment, not discretion. Thus it makes sense to talk in terms of a correlative right to the accommodation,  Page 12 \\x0c     rather than simply a right to apply for it. But that does not tell us whether it is a “civil right” for the purpose of article 6.    36.  As  Lord  Hoffmann  explained  in  R  (Alconbury  Developments  Ltd)  v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions [2001] UKHL 23, [2003] 2 AC 295, para 78 et seq, the concept of a “civil right” in article 6 was originally intended to apply only to private rights, not rights arising in public law. But that distinction has long been abandoned and the concept of the determination of  a  civil  right  extended  to  many  questions  arising  in  public  law.  With  that extension has gone some modification of what article 6 requires.   37.  Mr  Nigel  Giffin  QC,  appearing  for  Croydon,  has  helpfully  divided  the Strasbourg  cases  into  two  categories.  In  the  first  are  those  cases  where  the determination of a public law question is also decisive of the existence of private law rights. The obvious examples are Ringeisen v Austria (No 1) (1971) 1 EHRR 455, in which a contract for the sale of land between private citizens required the approval of the public authority; and Obermeier v Austria (1990) 13 EHRR 290, in which  the  dismissal  of  a  disabled  person  by  a  private  authority  required  the consent of a public authority; but the cases concerning the licensing of a trade or profession, such as Benthem v The Netherlands (1985) 8 EHRR 1, Albert and Le Compte v Belgium (1983) 5 EHRR 533, and Kingsley v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR  177,  directly  affecting  private  contractual  relationships,  also  fall  into  this category.   38. The  second  category,  however,  is  more  difficult  to  define.  Mr  Giffin suggests  that  it  consists  of  rights  in  public  law  which  are  closely  analogous  to rights in private law. These began with rights to contributory state benefits, which are clearly analogous to rights under private contracts of insurance (Feldbrugge v The Netherlands (1986) 8 EHRR 425). They have now been extended to rights to non-contributory  state  benefits,  which  have  also  been  recognised  as  rights  of property for the purpose of article 1 of the First Protocol (Salesi v Italy (1993) 26 EHRR 187; Mennitto v Italy (2000) 34 EHRR 1122; Mihailov v Bulgaria, app no 52367/99, judgment of 21 July 2005) and to the distribution of compensation for forced labour during the second world war (Wos v Poland (2006) 45 EHRR 659). They have also extended to some types of public sector employment, despite the clear  reluctance  of  many  European  countries  (including  the  United  Kingdom)  to regard  public  sector  employment  in  the  same  light  as  private  sector  employment (Vilho  Eskelinen  v  Finland  (2007)  45  EHRR  985).  But  there  remain  limits: taxation proceedings do not raise issues of civil rights, despite their obvious impact upon individual property rights (Ferrazzini v Italy (2001) 34 EHRR 1068); nor do immigration  decisions  (P  v  United  Kingdom  (1987)  54  DR  211);  or  decisions about state subsidies to housing associations (Woonbron Volkshuisvestingsgroep v The Netherlands, app no 47122/99, admissibility decision of 18 June 2002).  Page 13 \\x0c     39. So does a claim to be provided with welfare services by the state amount to a  civil  right  for  this  purpose?  The  House  of  Lords,  in  R  (Runa  Begum)  v  Tower Hamlets  London  Borough  Council  (First  Secretary  of  State  intervening)  [2003] UKHL 5, [2003] 2 AC 430, was content to assume, without deciding, that a claim to be provided with suitable accommodation under the homelessness provisions of Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 was such a right. But no Strasbourg case had yet gone so far. Mr Howell argues that the court has now done so; a number of cases from  Russia,  about  delays  in  enforcing  court  judgments  that  an  applicant  was entitled to be provided with a flat of a certain size, have taken it for granted that this was a civil right (see eg Teteriny v Russia, app no 11931/03, judgment of 30 June  2005;  Sypchenko  v  Russia,  app  no  38368/04,  judgment  of  1  March  2007). Enforcement only comes within article 6 because it is an intrinsic part of the trial. Thus, he argues, the underlying right to which the judgment relates must be a civil right.  There  is  no  requirement  in  the  Strasbourg  case  law  that  the  right  be analogous  with  a  right  existing  in  private  law,  for  the  non-contributory  state benefits have no such equivalent. All that is required is that the right is economic in nature and personal to the individual. This he gets from, for example, Salesi v Italy,  above,  where  the  court  said,  of  a  claimant  to  non-contributory  disability allowance,  “she  suffered  an  interference  with  her  means  of  subsistence  and  was claiming an individual, economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute”  (para  19).  It  does  not  have  to  be  tradable  and,  he  argues,  like  many ordinary private rights, it may well depend upon evaluative judgments rather than specific rules.   40.  On the other hand, it does not appear that there was any argument upon the point in the Russian cases and it is easy to slip into the assumption that once a right has been crystallised in a court judgment against a public authority it must amount to a civil right. In Loiseau v France, app no 46809/99, admissibility decision of 18 November  2003,  which  concerned  a  freedom  of  information  request  for  sight  of the applicant teacher’s personnel file, the court considered this a right of a private nature, firstly because “it concerns an individual right of which the applicant may consider  himself  the  holder”,  and  secondly  because  the  documents  requested “related  directly  and  exclusively  to  his  personal  situation”  (para  7).  Any entitlement  under  section  20(1)  does  not  depend  upon  discretion,  but  it  does depend upon an evaluation of some very “soft” criteria rather than specific rules, and it is difficult to say at what point the applicant may consider himself to be the holder of such a right. Hence, as Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe observed in Runa Begum, at para 115, if a right such as this is a “civil right” at all, it must lie close to the boundary of the concept and not at the core of what it entails. If so, this may have consequences for the second question, which is what article 6 requires.   41. In Runa Begum, the House decided that the process of decision-making on homelessness claims was sufficient to comply with article 6 if it applied at all. The initial decision was subject to review by another officer who had had nothing to do  Page 14 \\x0c     with the original decision and was subject to procedural rules designed to ensure a fair process. It was then subject to an appeal to the county court on conventional judicial  review  grounds.  The  reviewing  officer  was  not  independent  of  the  local authority but she was impartial. If she did not conduct her review in an impartial way, the court could correct this.   42. In  Tsfayo  v  United  Kingdom  (2006)  48  EHRR  457,  the  Strasbourg  court quoted  extensively  from  both  Alconbury  and  Runa  Begum  without  expressing either approval or disapproval. It drew three distinctions between those cases and the  determination  of  a  claim  for  housing  benefit  by  the  local  authority’s  housing benefit review board. First, the decision on the housing benefit claim was a simply question of whether or not the claimant had good cause for a late claim; it was not an issue requiring professional judgment as the decision on homelessness in Runa Begum had been. Second, it was a question of entitlement, not depending upon the application  of  government  policy  which  was  properly  the  province  of  the democratically accountable bodies, as the decision on the application of planning policy in Alconbury had been. Third, the review board was not merely lacking in independence.  It  could  not  be  an  impartial  tribunal  because  it  consisted  of councillors who were directly connected to the authority which would have to pay the benefit if it was awarded.   43.  Mr Howell argues that the social workers deciding upon section 20 claims cannot  be  “impartial”  as  required  by  article  6  because  they  are  employed  by  an authority with a direct financial interest in the outcome. Although their individual professionalism  is  not  in  doubt,  they  may  unconsciously  be  influenced  by  tacit pressures  from  their  seniors,  who  are  only  too  conscious  of  the  many  demands upon  the  children’s  services’  scarce  resources.  These  are  not  necessarily  fully compensated  by  payments  from  the  UK  Border  Agency.  In  any  event  it  is  not actual  bias  which  matters,  for  that  can  hardly  ever  be  proved,  but  the  “public perception of the possibility of unconscious bias” (in the words of Lord Steyn in Lawal  v  Northern  Spirit  Ltd  [2003]  UKHL  35,  [2003]  ICR  856,  at  para  14). Although judicial review may be able to cure actual bias, which leads the decision-maker to take irrelevant considerations into account or disregard the relevant ones, it cannot cure apparent unconscious bias of this kind.   44. I would be most reluctant to accept, unless driven by Strasbourg authority to do so, that article 6 requires the judicialisation of claims to welfare services of the  arguments  based  upon  statutory  construction  and this  kind.  Unlike jurisdictional fact, Mr Howell’s argument cannot sensibly distinguish between the determination  of  age  and  the  determination  of  the  other  criteria  of  entitlement. Every  decision  about  the  provision  of  welfare  services  has  resource  implications for the public authority providing the service. Public authorities exist to serve the public. They do so by raising and spending public money. If the officers making  Page 15 \\x0c     the decisions cannot be regarded as impartial, and the problem cannot be cured by the ordinary processes of judicial review based upon the usual criteria of legality, fairness and reasonableness or rationality, then tribunals will have to be set up to determine  the  merits  of  claims  to  children’s  services,  adult  social  services, education  services  and  many  more.  Resources  which  might  be  spent  on  the services  themselves  will  be  diverted  to  the  decision-making  process.  Such  a conclusion would be difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with the decision of this  House  in  Runa  Begum.  The  degree  of  judicialisation  required  of  an administrative  decision,  in  the  view  of  Lord  Hoffmann  in  Alconbury,  depends upon the “nature of the decision” (para 87, repeated in Runa Begum, para 33).   45. If this is a civil right at all, therefore, I would be inclined to hold that it rests at  the  periphery  of  such  rights  and  that  the  present  decision-making  processes, coupled with judicial review on conventional grounds, are adequate to result in a fair determination within the meaning of article 6.   Conclusion   46. For the reasons given earlier, however, I would allow these appeals and set aside the order of the Court of Appeal. The result is that if live issues remain about the age of a person seeking accommodation under section 20(1) of the 1989 Act, then the court will have to determine where the truth lies on the evidence available. It is not, however, entirely clear what relief the appellants now seek and so I would invite submissions upon this, and upon the question of costs, within fourteen days.    LORD HOPE    47. This  case  raises  two  distinct  issues  of  general  public  importance.  Their importance extends well beyond the facts of the two cases that are before us. On the one hand there is the question whether the word “child” in section 20(1) of the Children Act 1989 means, as the Court of Appeal held, a person whom the local authority  has  reasonable  grounds  for  believing  to  be  a  child:  [2008]  EWCA  Civ 1445; [2009] PTSR 1011, paras 30-31; or whether it raises a question of precedent fact which must be determined, if necessary, by a court. On the other there is the question whether a decision that the local authority makes as to whether or not to provide accommodation for a child in need under section 20(1) is a determination of a “civil right” within the meaning of article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights.      Page 16 \\x0c     48.  As  to  the  first  issue,  it  has  wider  implications  because  the  appellants  are both asylum seekers. The immediate question is how it is to be determined whether the appellants are under the age of eighteen and thus entitled to be considered for local  authority  support  under  Part  III  of  the  Children  Act  1989.  But,  as  the Secretary of State points out, an asylum seeker’s age will have implications too for the way in which his or her application for asylum will be treated. This is because the Secretary of State’s policy on returning unaccompanied minors usually leads to those whom he considers to be under the age of 18 being given discretionary leave to remain. Age, as such, is not a determinant as to a person’s immigration status. But it is relevant to the way the Secretary of State discharges his immigration and asylum  functions  and  the  exercise  of  his  powers  and  duties  to  provide  asylum support.  In  practice,  in  disputed  age  cases,  the  Secretary  of  State  follows  the assessment  that  has  been  arrived  at  by  the  local  authority.  As  a  result  any challenges to the lawfulness of the local authority’s assessment are likely to affect the way that the Secretary of State acts in reliance on the assessment.  His concern is that the appellant A’s contention that the question whether or not a person is a child  is,  in  the  event  of  challenge,  to  be  determined  by  a  court  will  result  in  an inappropriate  judicialisation  of  the  process.  The  suggestion  is  that  this  will  slow down the process and make it harder to administer.   49.  As to the second, a holding that the local authority’s decision as to whether or not to provide accommodation under section 20(1) of the 1989 Act amounted to the  determination  of  a  “civil  right”  would  have  far  reaching  implications.  This because  the  right  which  is  guaranteed  by  article  6(1)  is  to  a  decision  by  “an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.” As the House recognised in  Runa  Begum  v  Tower  Hamlets  London  Borough  Council  (First  Secretary  of State intervening) [2003] UKHL 5, [2003] 2 AC 430, it cannot plausibly be argued that  the  employees  of  the  local  authority  who  take  decisions  of  this  kind  on  its behalf are independent of the authority: see Lord Bingham of Cornhill, para 3, and Lord Hoffmann, para 27. The question then  is what must be done if the article’s requirements  are  to  be  satisfied.  In  Runa  Begum  the  House  held  that  the  county court’s  appellate  jurisdiction  under  section  204  of  the  Housing  Act  1996, exercising the normal judicial review jurisdiction of the High Court, was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the article. But, although the housing officer in that case  could  not  be  regarded  as  independent,  no  question  was  raised  as  to  her impartiality. In this case the impartiality of the social workers is challenged. This in  turn  raises  questions  as  to  the  intensity  of  any  judicial  review  that  must  be undertaken  if  the  requirements  of  article  6(1)  are  to  be  satisfied.  This  will  have implications as to the way decisions are taken in the provision of a wide range of public services.   50. The  facts  of  these  appeals  and  the  general  background  to  the  issues  they raise  have  been  summarised  by  Lady  Hale.  I  accept  her  valuable  description  of them with gratitude. I wish to add only a few words on the first issue, as I am in  Page 17 \\x0c     full  agreement  with  what  she  says.  As  for  the  second,  I  agree  with  her  that  it follows from our decision on the first issue that it is unnecessary to reach any firm conclusions on it. But I think that it is reasonably clear from the present state of the authorities how it should be answered. In view of its general importance I should like to explain the answer that I would give to it.    The section 20(1) issue   51. It seems to me that the question whether or not a person is a child for the purposes of section 20 of the 1989 Act is a question of fact which must ultimately be decided by the court. There is no denying the difficulties that the social worker is  likely  to  face  in  carrying  out  an  assessment  of  the  question  whether  an unaccompanied  asylum  seeker  is  or  is  not  under  the  age  of  18.  Reliable documentary evidence is almost always lacking in such cases.  So the process has to be one of assessment. This involves the application of judgment on a variety of factors,  as  Stanley  Burnton  J  recognised  in  R  (B)  v  Merton  London  Borough Council  [2003]  EWHC  Admin  1689,  [2003]  4  All  ER  280,  para  37.  But  the question  is  not  whether  the  person  can  properly  be  described  as  a  child.  Section 105(1) of the Act provides:     “In this Act – … “child” means, subject to paragraph 16 of Schedule 1, a person under the age of eighteen.”    The  question  is  whether  the  person  is,  or  is  not,  under  the  age  of  eighteen. However difficult it may be to resolve the issue, it admits of only one answer. As it is a question of fact, ultimately this must be a matter for the court.   52. In the Court of Appeal and in the argument before us, reference was made to the rule that where the exercise of executive power depends upon the precedent establishment of an objective fact, the courts will, if called upon to do so in a case of  dispute,  decide  whether  the  requirement  has  been  satisfied:  R  v  Secretary  of State  for  the  Home  Department,  Ex  p  Khawaja  [1984]  AC  74,  110,  per  Lord Scarman.  On  the  other  hand,  as  Sir  Thomas  Bingham  MR  observed  in  R  v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department,  ex  p  Onibiyo  [1996]  QB  768,  785, where  the  question  is  one  that  is  to  be  determined  by  the  executive  itself,  its determinations will be susceptible to challenge only on Wednesbury principles: R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Bugdaycay [1987] AC 514. In  Page 18 \\x0c     order  to  decide  into  which  class  of  judgment  the  case  falls  one  must,  of  course, first construe the statutory language used and the scheme of the legislation.    53. If, as the respondents contend, and Ward LJ in the Court of Appeal, para 25, accepted, the phrase “child in need” which sets the threshold for the provision of accommodation under section 20 must be taken as a whole, the judgment that must be  made  will  fall  into  the  latter  category. But the definition of  “child”  in  section 105(1)  applies  to  the  Act  as  a  whole,  without  qualification  or  exception.  The question whether the child is “in need” is for the social worker to determine. But the  question  whether  the  person  is  or  is  not  a  child  depends  entirely  upon  the person’s age, which is an objective fact. The scheme of the Act shows that it was not  Parliament’s  intention  to  leave  this  matter  to  the  judgment  of  the  local authority.            54.  As for the practical consequences, the process begins with the carrying out of an assessment of the person’s age by the social worker. Resort to the court will only be necessary in the event of a challenge to that assessment. So I do not accept that our conclusion will inevitably result in an inappropriate judicialisation of the process. It may, of course, require a judicial decision in some cases. But I would hope that the fact that the final decision rests with the court will assist in reducing the number of challenges. The initial decision taker must appreciate that no margin of discretion is enjoyed by the local authority on this issue. But the issue is not to be  determined  by  a  consideration  of  issues  of  policy  or  by  a  view  as  to  whether resort to a decision by the court in such cases is inappropriate. It depends entirely on the meaning of the statute. We must construe the Act as we find it. As I have said, when the subsection is properly construed in the light of what section 105(1) provides, the question admits of only one answer.   The article 6(1) issue   55.  Much  of  the  background  to  the  questions  which  this  issue  raises  was explored in Runa Begum v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council [2003] 2 AC 430.  With  that  advantage  we  can  examine  the  issue  from  the  point  where  that decision left it. On the other hand I would be very reluctant to take anything away from the carefully balanced conclusion that the House reached in that case unless driven  to  do  so  by  subsequent  guidance  from  Strasbourg.  As  Lord  Bingham explained in para 5, that case exposed more clearly than any earlier case had done the interrelation between the article 6(1) concept of “civil rights” on the one hand and the article 6(1) requirement of “an independent and impartial tribunal” on the other.  The narrower the interpretation that is given to “civil rights”, the greater the need to insist on review by a judicial tribunal exercising full powers. Conversely, the more elastic the interpretation that is given to the expression, the more flexible  Page 19 \\x0c     must be the approach to the requirement if over-judicialisation of welfare schemes is to be avoided. What the House did in that case was to assume, without deciding, that Runa Begum’s domestic right was also a “civil right” and, having made that assumption,  to  hold  that  the  absence  of  a  full  fact-finding  jurisdiction  in  the tribunal  from  which  an  appeal  lay  from  the administrative decision-making body did not disqualify the tribunal for the purposes of article 6(1): Lord Bingham, paras 6, 11; Lord Hoffmann, paras 58, 70.   56. In this case, having held that it was for the social workers to decide the age of the applicant, the Court of Appeal held that judicial review of their decision was sufficient  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  article  6(1):  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  1445, [2009]  PTSR  1011,  para  84.  Although  he  recognised  that,  having  reached  that view, it was not necessary for him to do so, Ward LJ went further and held that the right of accommodation given by section 20(1) was a right but that it could not be classified  as  a  “civil  right”  within  the  meaning  of  article  6(1)  because  too  much discretion was given to the local authority to decide what kind of accommodation is to be provided: para 59. Maurice Kay LJ and Sir John Chadwick expressed some hesitation  as  to  whether  this  was  a  right  at  all:  paras  92,  93.  The  effect  of  our decision  that  the  question  whether  the  applicant  is  or  is  not  under  eighteen  is  an objective fact which must ultimately be one for the court is that the issue will, in the  event  of  a  dispute,  be  decided  by  an  independent  and  impartial  tribunal  with powers which fully satisfy the requirements of article 6(1). The question whether the applicant is a child “in need” must then be for the social worker to deal with.  But  it  is  very  hard  to  see  how  an  unaccompanied  child  who  is  an  asylum  seeker could be otherwise than in need. This is not an issue that has been raised in these appeals.    57. In this situation it is open to us to regard the article 6(1) issue as academic and  to  say  no  more  about  it.  But  the  questions  were  fully  and  carefully  argued before  us,  and  they  are  of  general  public  importance.  We  are  as  well  informed about the present state of the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court as we can be.  With that advantage, I would venture these observations.   58. The  most  significant  development  since  the  decision  in  the  Runa  Begum case is the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo v United Kingdom (2006) 48 EHRR  457.  The  applicant  in  that  case  had  failed  to  renew  her  application  for housing  and  council  tax  benefit.  After  taking  advice  she  submitted  a  prospective claim  and  a  backdated  claim  for  both  types  of  benefit.  The  council  accepted  the prospective claim but rejected the backdated one on the ground that the applicant had failed to show good cause why she had not claimed these benefits earlier. The council’s housing benefit and council tax benefit review board rejected her appeal against this decision. Her complaint was that the board was not an independent and impartial  tribunal,  contrary  to  article  6(1).  The  court  held  that  disputes  about  Page 20 \\x0c     entitlement to social security and welfare benefits generally fell within the scope of article  6(1).  It  agreed  with  the  parties  that  the  applicant’s  claim  concerned  the determination of her civil rights, that article 6(1) applied and that she had a right to a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal: para 40. It held that the requirements  of  article  6(1)  had  been  violated.  The  board,  which  included  five councillors  from  the  local  authority  which  would  be  required  to  pay  the  benefit, lacked independence and the safeguards built into its procedure were not adequate to overcome this fundamental lack of objectivity. The review board had power to quash the council’s decision. But it did not have jurisdiction to rehear the evidence or substitute its own views as to the applicant’s credibility: paras 47, 48.   59. The  question  whether  the  claim  concerned  the  determination  of  the applicant’s civil rights was not disputed. This was not surprising, as the case fell within the mainstream of cases where the issue was one as to the entitlement to an amount  of  benefit  that  was  not  in  the  discretion  of  the  public  authority.  This  is shown  by  the  cases  referred  to  in  a  footnote  to  para  40:  Salesi  v  Italy  (1993)  26 EHRR 187, para 19; Schuler-Zgraggen v Switzerland (1993) 16 EHRR 405, para 46;  Mennitto  v  Italy  (2000)  34  EHRR  1122,  para  28.  As  Lord  Walker  of Gestingthorpe  said  in  Runa  Begum  v  Tower  Hamlets  London  Borough  Council [2003]  2  AC  430,  para  112,  these  cases,  which  started  with  Feldbrugge  v  The Netherlands (1986) 8 EHRR 425, indicate that article 6(1) is likely to be engaged when  the  applicant  has  public  law  rights  which  are  of  a  personal  and  economic nature and do not involve any large measure of official discretion. As the court put in Salesi v Italy, para 19, the applicant was claiming an individual, economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute.  In Mennitto v Italy, para 23, the court  said  that  the  outcome  of  the  proceedings  must  be  directly  decisive  for  the right in question.   60. In Tsfayo v United Kingdom the court directed its attention to the decision-making  process.  It  quoted,  with  approval,  Lord  Bingham’s  description  of  the interrelation between the article 6(1) concept of “civil rights” and the requirement for an “independent and impartial tribunal”: para 31.  The case was decided against the  United  Kingdom  because,  in  contrast  to  Runa  Begum  and  Bryan  v  United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHRR 342 where the issues to be decided required a measure of professional knowledge or experience and the exercise of discretion pursuant to wider  policy  aims,  the  review  board  in  Ms  Tsfayo’s  case  was  deciding  a  simple question of fact, namely whether there was good cause for her delay in making the claim. So far as it goes, this decision supports the view that in cases which concern the  provision  of  welfare  services  of  the  nature  at  issue  in  these  appeals  judicial review  of  the  kind  contemplated  in  Runa  Begum  will  meet  the  requirements  of article 6(1).  As the court explained in para 46:    Page 21 \\x0c     “No specialist expertise was required to determine this issue, which is,  under  the  new  system,  determined  by  a  non-specialist  tribunal. Nor,  unlike  the  cases  referred  to  [Bryan  and  Runa  Begum],  can  the factual findings in the present case be said to be merely incidental to the reaching of broader judgments of policy or expediency which it was for the democratically accountable authority to take.”   61. I read this passage as an endorsement of the point that Lord Bingham made in Runa Begum, para 5, that if an elastic interpretation is given to the article 6(1) concept  of  “civil  rights”  flexibility  must  also  be  given  to  the  procedural requirements  of  that  article  if  over-judicialisation  of  the  administrative  welfare schemes is to be avoided.  But it is important, too, to recognise that in Tsfayo, as in Runa Begum, the question whether, and if so at what point, administrative welfare schemes fall outside the scope of article 6(1) altogether was not tested. Tsfayo, as I have  said,  fell  within  the  mainstream  of  cases  about  social  security  and  welfare benefits. In Runa Begum the House preferred not to take a decision on this issue.   62. There  are,  however,  a  number  of  straws  in  the  wind  that  have  been generated by the decisions from Strasbourg since Runa Begum that suggest that a distinction  can  now  be  made  between  the  class  of  social  security  and  welfare benefits that is of the kind exemplified by Salesi v Italy and those benefits which are,  in  their  essence,  dependent  upon  the  exercise  of  judgment  by  the  relevant authority.    The  phrase  “civil  rights”  is,  of  course,  an  autonomous  concept:  eg Woobron Volkshuisvestingsgroep v The Netherlands, application no 47122/99), 18 June  2002  (unreported).  But  it  does  convey  the  idea  of  what,  in  Stec  v  United Kingdom (2005) 41 EHRR SE18, para 48, the Strasbourg court referred to as “an assertable right”. In that paragraph, having  declared  that  the  Convention  must  be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and  harmony  between  its  various  provisions,  and  in  para  49  that  it  is  in  the interests  of  the  Convention  as  a  whole  that  the  autonomous  concept  of “possession” in article 1 of Protocol No 1 should be interpreted in a way which is consistent  with  the  concept  of  pecuniary  rights  in  article  6(1),  the  court  said,  at para 51:   “In the modern, democratic state, many individuals are, for all or part of  their  lives,  completely  dependent  for  survival  on  social  security and  welfare  benefits.  Many  domestic  legal  systems  recognise  that such  individuals  require  a  degree  of  certainty  and  security,  and provide  for  benefits  to  be  paid  –  subject  to  the  fulfilment  of  the conditions  of  eligibility  –  as  of  right.  Where  an  individual  has  an assertable  right  under  domestic  law  to  a  welfare  benefit,  the importance of that interest should also be reflected by holding article 1 of Protocol No 1 to be applicable.”   Page 22 \\x0c     63. The  court’s  references  in  Loiseau  v  France  application  no  46809/99,  18 November  2003  (unreported),  para  7,  to  “a  ‘private  right’  which  can  be  said,  at least  on  arguable  grounds,  to  be  recognised  under  domestic  law”  and  to  “an individual  right  of  which  the  applicant  may  consider  himself  the  holder”  are consistent with this approach. So too are the references in Mennitto v Italy (2002) 34  EHRR  1122,  para  23,  to  “a  ‘right’  which  can  be  said,  at  least  on  arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law”, where the court added:   “The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its  exercise.  The  outcome  of  the  proceedings  must  be  directly decisive for the right in question.” [emphasis added]   Cases  where  the  award  of  benefit  is  dependent  upon  a  series  of  evaluative judgments as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and, if so, how the need for it as assessed ought to be met do not answer to that description.   64. The  exact  limits  of  the  autonomous  concept  remain  elusive.  One  can  be confident that cases where the relationship between the beneficiary and the public authority  is  of  a  public  law  character,  as  in Woodbron  v  The  Netherlands, where the role of the applicant associations in regard to the construction and maintenance of  public  housing  was  of  a  typically  general  interest  character,  fall  outside  its scope. Mr Howell QC submitted that there is no distinction to be drawn between the forms in which welfare benefits may be provided. But none of the Strasbourg authorities go that far, and the carefully worded passages from Loiseau v France and Stec v United Kingdom to which I have referred seem to me to contradict his proposition. The series of cases about the enforcement of judgments made by the courts about social housing in Russia to which he referred, of which the latest is Nagovitsyn v Russia application no 6859/02, 24 January 2008 (not reported), offer no assistance as the question whether a duty to provide social housing gives rise to a “civil right” was not argued.   65. For  these  reasons  I  think  that  it  can  now  be  asserted  with  reasonable confidence that the duty of the local authority under section 20(1) of the 1989 Act to provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them  to  require  accommodation  as  a  result  of  the  factors  mentioned  in  that subsection does not give rise to a “civil right” within the meaning of article 6(1) of the Convention.           Page 23 \\x0c       LORD SCOTT    66. I  have  found  Lady  Hale’s  discussion  of  the  issues  raised  illuminating  and her  reasons  for  the  conclusions  she  has  expressed  convincing.  I  cannot  usefully add anything or improve upon those reasons and gratefully associate myself with them.  I  would,  therefore,  for  the  reasons  she  has  given,  allow  these  appeals  and adopt the suggestion she has made in the last sentence of her opinion.    LORD WALKER    67. I  am  in  full  agreement  with  the  judgment  of  Lady  Hale.  In  his  judgment Lord  Hope  gives  powerful  reasons  for  concluding  that  a  local  authority’s  duty under section 20(1) of the Children Act 1989 is not a “civil right” for the purposes of Article 6(1). But the Court does not have to decide that point in order to dispose of this appeal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence is still developing. I would prefer to leave the point open, while acknowledging the force of Lord Hope’s reasoning.    LORD NEUBERGER    68.  For the reasons given by Lady Hale, I too would allow this appeal.

I agree with it and, for the reasons which he gives, I would dismiss the appeal. 3. The  appellant,  Mr  Louca,  is  a  Cypriot  national  whose  arrest  in  England  and surrender  to  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  for  trial  of  six  alleged  offences  of  tax evasion  is  sought  by  the  Office  of  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Bielefeld  pursuant  to  a European Arrest Warrant dated 14 July 2008. The warrant was on that date certified by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (“SOCA”) pursuant to s.2(7) of the Extradition Act 2003. Mr Louca challenges its validity on the ground that it contains no reference to two previous  European  arrest  warrants  (likewise  certified  by  SOCA),  but  refers  only  to  a domestic  German  arrest  warrant.  A  reference  to  any  previous  European  arrest  warrants, was,  he  submits,  essential  under  s.2(2)(a)  and  (4)(b)  of  the  2003  Act,  which,  read together,  require  a  warrant  to  contain  “particulars  of  any  other  warrant  issued  in  the category 1 territory for the person’s arrest in respect of the offence”. Senior District Judge Workman  rejected  Mr  Louca’s  challenge  on  11  September  2008,  and  the  Divisional Court, in a judgment given by Dyson LJ, dismissed his appeal on 27 November 2008. 4. The two previous European arrest warrants were issued and in turn superseded in a  manner  that  appears  not  uncommon  in  relation  to  requests  by  overseas  authorities  for the arrest of suspects in England. The first warrant was dated 14 September 2006 and led to Mr Louca’s arrest on 9 April 2008. Shortly thereafter it was withdrawn, Mr Louca was discharged from further proceedings on it, and a second warrant dated 23 April 2008 was issued on which Mr Louca was again arrested on 25 April 2008. That warrant amplified the  description  of  Mr  Louca’s  alleged  involvement  in  the  offences  and  contained  other minor  changes.  It  was  in  turn  withdrawn,  Mr  Louca  was  again  discharged  from  any proceedings on it, and it was replaced by the subsisting warrant dated 14 July 2008, upon which  Mr  Louca  was  again  arrested  and  which  is  now  before  the  Supreme  Court.  The  Page 2 \\x0c        wording  of  the  subsisting  warrant  differs  from  that  of  the  second  warrant  only  in  the insertion of the words which I have italicised in the time-frame and places of commission given for the alleged offences: “From a few days before the 23rd April 2003, till the 8th of April 2004” and “Minden, Seckenhausen and other places in the Federal Republic of Germany, including the borders of Germany”. 5. Part I of the 2003 Act, in which s.2 appears, falls to be read in the context of the Council  Framework  Decision  of  13  June  2002  on  the  European  arrest  warrant  and  the surrender procedures between member states of the European Union (2002/584/JHA; OJ 2002  L190,  pl).  This  is  a  “ground-breaking  measure  intended  to  simplify  and  expedite procedures  for  the  surrender,  between  member  states,  of  those  accused  of  crime committed in other member states or required to be sentenced or serve sentences for such crimes following  conviction in  other  member  states”:  Dabas v High  Court  of Justice of Madrid, Spain [2007] UKHL 6; [2007] 2 AC 31, para. 4, per Lord Bingham of Cornhill. Although  article 34(2)(b) of the Treaty on European Union makes framework decisions “binding  upon  member  states  as  to  the  result  to  be  achieved  but  [leaves]  to  national authorities the choice of form and methods”, a national court must interpret a national law “as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the framework decision in order to attain the result which it pursues and thus comply with article 34(2)(b)”: para. 5, per Lord Bingham citing Criminal Proceedings against Pupino (Case C-105/03); [2006] QB 83, paras. 43 and 47. 6. The Framework Decision provides inter alia: Article 1(1): The European arrest warrant is a judicial decision issued by a Member State with a view to the arrest and surrender by another Member State  of  a  requested  person,  for  the  purposes  of  conducting  a  criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or detention order. Article 2(1): A European arrest warrant may be issued for acts punishable by  the  law  of  the  issuing  Member  State  by  a  custodial  sentence  or  a detention  order  for  a  maximum  period  of  at  least  12  months  or,  where  a sentence has been passed or a detention order has been made, for sentences of at least four months. ….. ……” Article  8(1):  The  European  arrest  warrant  shall  contain  the  following information set out in accordance with the form contained in the Annex: (a) the identity and nationality of the requested person;  Page 3 \\x0c      the  name,  address,  telephone  and  fax  numbers  and  e-mail  address (b) of the issuing judicial authority; (c) evidence of an enforceable judgment, an arrest warrant or any other enforceable  judicial  decision  having  the  same  effect,  coming  within  the scope of Articles 1 and 2; the  nature  and  legal  classification  of  the  offence,  particularly  in (d) respect of Article 2; (e) a  description  of  the  circumstances  in  which  the  offence  was committed,  including  the  time,  place  and  degree  of  participation  in  the offence by the requested person; (f) the penalty imposed, if there is a final judgment, or the prescribed scale  of  penalties  for  the  offence  under  the  law  of  the  issuing  Member State; (g) if possible, other consequences of the offence.”  The annexed form contains boxes for completion, including: (b)   Decision on which warrant is based:  1. Arrest warrant or judicial decision having the same effect: ….. Type: …….. 2. Enforceable judgement: ……………. Reference: …………..” and “(f)   Other circumstances relevant to the case (optional information): (NB This could cover remarks on extraterritoriality, interruption of periods of time limitation and other consequences of the offence) …………”   7. In  the  present  case,  box  (b)  of  the  form  was  completed  in  the  European  arrest warrant (as in the two withdrawn warrants) with a reference to a domestic warrant issued by the Bielefeld County Court reference 9Gs 2740/06 dated 27 July 2006 for Mr Louca’s “imprisonment on remand”.  Page 4 \\x0c        In Ruiz v Central Criminal Court of Criminal Proceedings No 5 of the National 8. Court, Madrid [2007] EWHC 2983 (Admin); [2008] 1 WLR 2798, Dyson LJ in an obiter dictum rejected a prosecution submission that “the enforceable judgment, etc. [referred to in article 8(1)(c) of the Framework Decision] is the domestic warrant on which the index EAW  is  based”  (para.  26).  The  words  in  article  8(1)(c)  “coming  within  the  scope  of Articles 1 and 2” in his view precluded that submission, on the basis that Articles 1 and 2 were only concerned with European arrest warrants. The actual decision was that article 8(1)(c) and s.2(4)(b) were only concerned with currently enforceable warrants. However, Dyson LJ’s view that they were also only concerned with European arrest warrants was adopted in Zakowski v Regional Court in Szczecin Poland [2008] EWHC 1389 (Admin). That  was  a  case  on  s.2(6)(c)  of  the  2003  Act,  which  mirrors  the  language  of  s.2(4)  in relation to the situation of a person unlawfully at large after conviction. Maurice Kay LJ, with  whom  Penry-Davey  J  agreed,  held  that  s.6(2)(c)  “should  be  construed  as  referring only to other EAWs issued in respect of the offence” (paras. 25-26). 9.  In  his  judgment  in  the  present  case,  Dyson  LJ  reconsidered  the  position  and concluded that the interpretation of ss.2(4)(b) and 2(6)(c) proposed in Ruiz and adopted in Zakowski was wrong. His reasoning covered five points: (i) the Framework Decision does not  in  article  8(1)(c)  use  the  phrase  “European  arrest  warrant”,  as  it  does  consistently elsewhere  when  referring  to  such  a  warrant;  (ii)  the  concepts  of  “an  enforceable judgment, an arrest warrant or any other enforceable judicial decision” cannot easily be understood as limited to an European arrest warrant; (iii) the phrase “coming within the scope  of  Articles  1  and  2”  can  and  should  simply  be  understood  as  meaning  that  the enforceable judgment, arrest warrant or other enforceable judicial decision must be “for the  purposes  of  conducting  a  criminal  prosecution  or  executing  a  custodial  sentence  or detention  order”  and  be  “issued  for  acts  punishable  by  the  law  of  the  issuing  Member State  by  a  custodial  sentence  or  a  detention  order  for  a  maximum  period  of  at  least  12 months  or,  where  a  sentence  has  been  passed  or  a  detention  order  has  been  made,  for sentences of at least four months”; (iv) one European arrest warrant is most unlikely to be based  on  another,  and  (v)  there  is  no  point  in  requiring  such  a  warrant  to  contain information  about  an  earlier  European  arrest  warrant  on  which  it  is  not  based,  and  on which reliance is no longer placed. On this basis, the present Divisional Court held that article 8(1)(c) and ss.2(4)(b) 10. and  2(6)(c)  are  concerned  with  domestic  judgments,  arrest  warrants  or  other  decisions, and not with any other European arrest warrant issued in respect of the alleged offending, still  less  one  which  has  been  withdrawn.  Before  the  House  in  July  2009,  Mr  Conor Quigley QC had to accept the first part of this conclusion – inevitably so, in my view, in the  light  of  the  first  four  reasons  given  by  Dyson  LJ  and  also  having  regard  to  article 8(1)(c)  of  and  box  (b)  in  the  form  annexed  to  the  Framework  Decision.  It  is  entirely understandable that the Framework Decision should require a European arrest warrant to set out its jurisdictional basis in the domestic law of the issuing state. 11.  Mr  Quigley  submitted,  nonetheless,  that  the  latter  part  of  the  Divisional  Court’s decision does not follow, and challenged Dyson LJ’s fifth reason. There is a purpose, he  Page 5 \\x0c        argued,  in  also  requiring  evidence  of  any  other  European  arrest  warrant,  even  if withdrawn, because this could constitute the basis of, or be relevant to, a decision by the executing court to set aside or consider whether to set aside the subsisting European arrest warrant as an abuse of process. He relied upon the statement by Bingham LJ, as he was, in R v. Liverpool Stipendiary Magistrates ex p. Ellison [1990] RTR 220, 227 that: “If any criminal court at any time has cause to suspect that a prosecutor may be manipulating or using the procedures of the  court  in  order  to  oppress  or  unfairly  to  prejudice  a defendant  before  the  court,  I  have  no  doubt  that  it  is  the duty of the court to inquire into the situation and ensure that its procedure is not being so abused. Usually no doubt such inquiry will be prompted by a complaint on the part of the defendant. But the duty of the court in my view exists even in the absence of a complaint.”  12. In  support  of  these  submissions,  Mr  Quigley  pointed  to  various  recitals  in  the Framework  Decision.  Under  recital  (8),  “the  execution  of  the  European  arrest  warrant must be  subject  to sufficient  controls”;  under recital (10), its mechanism is “based on a high  level  of  confidence  between  Member  States”.  and  under  recital  (12),  the “Framework Decision respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union” and “does not prevent a Member State from applying its constitutional  rules  relating  to  due  process”.  Mr  Quigley  noted  that,  under  Article  8(1), “The  European  arrest  warrant  shall  contain  the  following  information  set  out  in accordance with the form contained in the Annex: …..(g) if possible, other consequences of  the  offence”.  He  suggested  that,  in  order  to  give  effect  to  all  these  provisions, ss.2(4)(b)  and  2(6)(c)  must  be  understood  as  embracing  not  only  domestic  judgments, warrants  or  decisions,  but  also  prior  European  arrest  warrants,  even  if  withdrawn. Otherwise, mutual confidence would not be promoted and the executing court would not be able to inquire into whether there had been any abuse of process.  13. In  my  opinion,  this  is  to  seek  to  make  bricks  without  straw.  The  words  “if possible,  other  consequences  of  the  offence”  and  box  (f)  in  the  annexed  form  “Other circumstances  relevant  to  the  case  (optional  information)”  do  not  carry  the  obligatory connotation  for  which  Mr  Quigley  argues;  the  note  to  box  (f)  lends  no  support  to  Mr Quigley’s case; and there is no reason to read ss.2(4)(b) and 2(6)(c) in the 2003 Act as intended to require the executing court to be informed by the European arrest warrant of one  (and  only  one)  point  -  the  existence  of  another  European  arrest  warrant  -  which might,  in  some  conceivable  case,  be  of  some  conceivable  relevance  to  an  argument  of abuse  of  process.  The  duty  which  a  criminal  court  may  have,  if  prosecution  authorities appear to be committing an abuse of process, is no basis for reading either the Framework Decision or the 2003 Act as requiring the inclusion in a European arrest warrant of that or any  other  information  on  which  a  defendant  wishing  to  raise  an  argument  of  abuse  of  Page 6 \\x0cprocess might conceivably wish to rely. Ss.2(4)(b) and 2(6)(c) are designed on their face simply  to  give  effect  to  article  8(1)(c)  and  box  (b)  in  the  annexed  form.  Other  “due process”  factors  are  comprehensively  covered  by  ss.11  to  20,  dealing  with  double jeopardy, extraneous considerations, passage of time, age, hostage-taking considerations, speciality, earlier extradition to the United Kingdom and trial in absentia, as well as by the  general  safeguard  in  s.21  that  the  judge  must  decide  whether  surrender  would  be compatible with the European Human Rights Convention rights.  14. The  unreal  consequences  of  the  appellant’s  argument  in  this  particular  case  also need  no  stressing.  Mr  Louca  was  arrested  under  the  previous  European  arrest  warrants, and  he  and  his  advisers  were  fully  aware  at  every  stage  of  their  issue  and  withdrawal. Their  withdrawal  and  the  changes  made  in  successive  warrants  lend  no  support  to  any suggestion of abuse of process. (Arguments based on oppression due to passage of time and  interference  with  the  right  to  family  life  were  mounted,  unavailingly,  in  the  courts below.) Mr Quigley was nevertheless compelled by his argument to submit that, however obvious  it  might  be  that  the  reason  for  the  withdrawal  of  a  previous  European  arrest warrant was technical or irrelevant to any question of abuse of process, a new European arrest warrant would be invalid unless it gave particulars of the previous warrant.  15. The question certified by the Divisional Court is: “Whether the reference to ‘any other warrant’ in ss.2(4)(b) and 2(6)(c) of the Extradition Act 2003 properly construed is a reference to any other domestic warrant on which the European arrest warrant is based”. For the reasons given above and those given by the Divisional Court, the answer is that the reference is to any domestic warrant on which the European arrest warrant is based, and not to any other European arrest warrant which may have been issued on the basis of any such domestic warrant. Mr Louca’s appeal falls to be dismissed accordingly. I  too  agree  with  the  opinion  prepared  by  Lord  Mance,  and  I  would  dismiss  the              LORD COLLINS 16. appeal.

His extradition is sought by the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Bielefeld, Germany, for six offences  of  tax  evasion  under  a European  Arrest  Warrant (“EAW”) dated 14 July 2008. Two previous EAWs had been issued by the German Prosecutor, each resulting in the arrest of Mr Louca in April 2008, but were successively withdrawn because of minor technicalities. The current EAW refers to the domestic German arrest warrant but not to the previous, withdrawn, EAWs. Mr Louca argued that it was unlawful to extradite him under an EAW which did not refer to all the previous EAWs.', 'Judgment': 'The Supreme Court holds that, when a European Arrest Warrant is issued by the authorities of one Member State for execution in another, it must include a reference to the domestic warrant upon which the European Arrest Warrant is based, but need not include references to any other European Arrest Warrant which may have been issued on the basis of the domestic warrant. The appeal is therefore dismissed. (Paragraph [15])', 'Reasons for the judgment': '\\uf0b7  Lord Mance gave the judgment of the Court, upholding the reasoning of the Divisional Court. The  words  “any  other  warrant”  in  section  2(4)(c)  of  the  Extradition  Act  2003  must  be construed in the light of the European Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European  Arrest  Warrant  and  the  surrender  procedures  between  Member  States  of  the European Union. (Paragraph [3]).  \\uf0b7  The  Framework  Decision  does  not  require  “any  other  warrant”  to  include  previous  EAWs. The relevant part of the Decision – article 8(1)(c) – does not use the phrase “European arrest warrant” as it does elsewhere. The reference to “an enforceable judgment, an arrest warrant or any other enforceable judicial decision” (article 8(1)(c)) cannot sensibly be limited to an EAW. One EAW is most unlikely to be based upon another. (Paragraphs [9]-[10])  \\uf0b7  There  was  no  other  reason  to  require  the  EAW  to  include  information  about  prior  EAWs upon which no reliance was being placed. Not doing so would not prevent Mr Louca arguing that extradition was an abuse of process, and other due process factors were comprehensively covered by the Extradition Act.

The ability of asylum seekers who make unsuccessful claims to be allowed to  remain  to  discover  further  reasons  why  they  should  not  be  removed  from  the country where they seek refuge is an inescapable feature of any system that is put in place to meet a State’s obligations under the Geneva Convention on the Status of  Refugees  and  article  3  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.  The opportunity  for  further  reasons  to  be  put  forward  is  enhanced  by  the  fact  that  a series  of  decisions  may  need  to  be  taken  before  a  person’s  immigration  status  is resolved. Various measures have been put in place by the United Kingdom to deal with this phenomenon. Some of these measures are to be found in the Immigration Rules,  and  on  occasion  the  meaning  that  is  to  be  given  to  them  is  the  subject  of controversy: see ZT (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] UKHL 6, [2009] 1 WLR 348.     2. In  this  case  however  we  are  concerned  with  meaning  and  effect  of  the statute.  The  relevant  provisions  are  to  be  found  in  Part  5  of  the  Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  which  deals  with  immigration  and  asylum appeals.  The  question  is  whether  the  expression  “an  asylum  claim,  or  a  human rights  claim”  in  section  92(4)(a)  of  the  2002  Act  includes  any  second  or subsequent claim that the asylum seeker may make, or only a second or subsequent claim which has been accepted as a “fresh claim” by the Secretary of State under rule 353 of the Immigration Rules.   The facts   3. The first respondent BA is a citizen of Nigeria. He is married to a British citizen, by whom he has four children.  He entered the United Kingdom in 1988 as a  visitor.  Initially  he  was  given  six  months  leave  to  enter.  Later  he  was  granted leave  to  remain  as  a  student  until  the  end  of  August  1991.  He  was  granted indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  25  May  1994  on  the  basis  of  his  marriage.  On  20 May 2005, however, he was served with a decision by the Secretary of State that he was to be deported following his release on licence from a 10 year sentence of imprisonment  for  conspiracy  to  import  class  A  drugs.  His  appeal  against  this decision  to  the  asylum  and  immigration  tribunal  on  human  rights  grounds  failed.  On 25 May 2007 he was served with a deportation order. On 25 June 2007 and 8 August 2007 further submissions were made on his behalf as to why he should not be  deported.  The  Secretary  of  State  agreed  to  consider  his  reasons  for  seeking revocation of the deportation order, but she declined to revoke it. Directions were then given for him to be removed from this country on 29 December 2007.   Page 2 \\x0c     4. The  respondent  PE  is  a  citizen  of  Cameroon.  He  entered  the  United Kingdom clandestinely in August 2004. On 19 May 2005 he applied for asylum. The Secretary of State refused his application on 5 July 2005. On 9 July 2005 it was decided that directions were to be given for his removal to Cameroon. He did not  appeal  against  this  decision.  Before  it  was  put  into  effect  however  he  was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for having a forged passport and using it to obtain work, to which he had pleaded guilty. As a result of this conviction the Secretary  of  State  decided  to  make  a  deportation order against him. He appealed against  this  decision  on  asylum  and  human  rights  grounds,  but  his  appeal  was dismissed.  The  deportation  order  was  signed,  and  it  was  served  on  him  on  10 January  2007.  On  various  dates  thereafter  his  representatives  made  written representations on his behalf for the decision to be reconsidered. They claimed that he  had  been  and  would  be  persecuted  in  Cameroon  on  account  of  his homosexuality.  The  Secretary  of  State  declined  to  reconsider  her  decision,  as  in her  view  his  further  representations  did  not  amount  to  a  fresh  claim  within  the meaning of rule 353 of the Immigration Rules. He appealed to the tribunal against the  Secretary  of  State’s  refusal  to  revoke  her  decision  to  make  the  order.  The tribunal held that this decision was not an appealable decision.    5. On 27 December 2007 BA applied for judicial review of the directions for his removal. He contended that he had a further in-country right of appeal. It was no part of his case that his further representations amounted to a fresh claim under rule 353 of the Immigration Rules. PE had already applied for judicial review of the  decisions  that  had  been  made  against  him.  He  claimed  that  he  had  a  right  of appeal  against  a  refusal  to  revoke  the  deportation  order,  that  this  right  was exercisable  in-country  and  that  in  any  event  the  representations  amounted  to  a fresh  claim  under  rule  353.  Permission  was  given  in  each  case,  and  the applications were heard together by Blake J: [2008] EWHC 1140 (Admin); [2008] 4  All  ER  798.  The  judge  held  that  what  determined  whether  there  was  an  in-country  right  of  appeal  was  whether  or  not  the  Secretary  of  State  was  satisfied under rule 353 there was a fresh claim: para 62. In his opinion neither claimant had an in-country right of appeal simply by virtue of having made a protection claim or having made fresh representations supported by different material: para 74. In PE’s case  he  quashed  the  decision  that  his  was  not  a  fresh  claim  and  remitted  it  for redetermination  by  the  Secretary  of  State.  He  said  that  if  the  Secretary  of  State were  to  conclude  that  the  claim  is  a  fresh  one  but  it  was  still  refused,  PE  would have access to a right of appeal in-country before removal. But if it was not a fresh claim, his right to appeal would have to be exercised from abroad. As Sedley LJ observed  in  the  Court  of  Appeal,  this  conclusion  raises  the  same  issue  as  that raised by BA’s appeal: [2009] EWCA Civ 119; [2009] 2 WLR 1370, para 4.   6. is headed “Fresh claims”. It provides:     Rule 353 of the Immigration Rules, on which the Secretary of State relies,  Page 3 \\x0c     “353. When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused … and any  appeal  relating  to  that  claim  is  no  longer  pending,  the  decision maker  will  consider  any  further  submissions  and,  if  rejected,  will then  determine  whether  they  amount  to  a  fresh  claim.  The submissions  will  amount  to  a  fresh  claim  if  they  are  significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content: (i) (ii) had not already been considered; and taken  together  with  the  previously  considered  material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.”   Rule 353A, which needs to be read together with rule 353 to complete the picture, provides:   “353A.  Consideration  of  further  submissions  shall  be  subject  to  the procedures set out in these Rules. An applicant who has made further submissions  shall  not  be  removed  before  the  Secretary  of  State  has considered the submissions under paragraph 353 or otherwise. This paragraph does not apply to submissions made overseas.”   The 2002 Act   7. This  Act  was  passed  in  the  light  of  strong  pressure  to  streamline  appeals against immigration decisions in the light of objections that were taken to the large number  of  repeat  claims.  Part  5  of  the  Act  provides  a  general  right  of  appeal against  an  immigration  decision  to  an  adjudicator:  section  82(1).  The  expression “immigration decision” is defined in section 82(2). It includes, among other things, a  decision  that  a  person  is  to  be  removed  from  the  United  Kingdom  who  is  here unlawfully,  a  decision  to  make  a  deportation  order  under  section  5(1)  of  the  Act and a refusal to revoke a deportation order under section 5(2): sections 82(2)(g), (j) and  (k).  Having  defined  this  expression,  the  statute  proceeds  to  lay  down  an elaborate system for the handling of appeals.   8. Section  84(1)  provides  that  an  appeal  under  section  82(1)  against  an immigration decision must be brought under one or more of the grounds specified in that subsection. They include the following ground, with a view to ensuring that the United Kingdom complies with its international obligations:    Page 4 \\x0c     “(g)  that  removal  of  the  appellant  from  the  United  Kingdom  in consequence  of  the  immigration  decision  would  breach  the  United Kingdom’s  obligations  under  the  Refugee  Convention  or  would  be unlawful  under  section  6  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  as  being incompatible with the appellant’s Convention rights.”   This is the ground on which both BA and PE rely.     9.   Section 92, as amended, provides: “(1) A person may not appeal under section 82(1) while he is in the United Kingdom unless his appeal is of a kind to which this section applies. (2) This section applies to an appeal against an immigration decision of a kind specified in section 82(2)(c), (d),(e), (f) . . . and (j). (3) This section also applies to an appeal against refusal of leave to enter the United Kingdom if – (a) at the time of the refusal the appellant is in the United Kingdom, and (b)  on  his  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom  the  appellant  had  entry clearance. … (4)  This  section  also  applies  to  an  appeal  against  an  immigration decision if the appellant – (a) has made an asylum claim, or a human rights claim, while in the United Kingdom, or (b) is an EEA national or a member of the family of an EEA national and  makes  a  claim  to  the  Secretary  of  State  that  the  decision breaches  the  appellant’s  rights  under  the  Community  Treaties  in respect of entry to or residence in the United Kingdom.”   The respondents’ case is that section 92(4)(a) confers a suspensive in-country right of appeal unless the appeal has been certified under either section 94 or section 96 of  the  2002  Act.  It  is  suspensive  because  it  suspends  the  operation  of  the immigration decision appealed against until the appeal has been disposed of.   10. Section  94  excludes  appeals  in  asylum  and  human  rights  cases  if  the Secretary  of  State  certifies  that  they  are  clearly  unfounded.  The  relevant subsections, as amended, provide as follows:  Page 5 \\x0c     “(1) This section applies to an appeal under section 82(1) where the appellant  has  made  an  asylum  claim  or  a  human  rights  claim  (or both).  (2) A person may not bring an appeal to which this section applies in reliance on section 92(4)(a) if the Secretary of State certifies that the claim  or  claims  mentioned  in  subsection  (1)  is  or  are  clearly unfounded. … (9) Where a person in relation to whom a certificate is issued under this section subsequently brings an appeal under section 82(1) while outside the United Kingdom, the appeal shall be considered as if he had not been removed from the United Kingdom.”   11. Section 96 removes the right of appeal altogether if the Secretary of State or an  immigration  officer  certifies  that  the  person  has  dealt  with,  or  ought  to  have dealt with, the issue in an earlier appeal. The relevant subsections of section 96, as amended, are in these terms:   “(1) An appeal under section 82(1) against an immigration decision (“the new decision”) in respect of a person may not be brought if the Secretary of State or an immigration officer certifies – (a) that the person was notified of a right of appeal under that section immigration  decision  (‘the  old  decision’) against  another (whether  or  not  an  appeal  was  brought  and  whether  or  not  any appeal brought has been determined), (b) that  the  claim  or  application  to  which  the  new  decision  relates relies on a matter that could have been raised in an appeal against the old decision, and (c) that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Secretary  of  State  or  the  immigration officer, there is no satisfactory reason for that matter not having been raised in an appeal against the old decision.  (2)  An  appeal  under  section  82(1)  against  an  immigration  decision (‘the new decision’) in respect of a person may not be brought if the Secretary of State or an immigration officer certifies  (a) that the person received a notice under section 120 by virtue of an application other than that to which the new decision relates or by virtue of a decision other than the new decision,   Page 6 \\x0c     (b) that the new decision relates to an application or claim which relies on a matter that should have been, but has not been, raised in a statement made in response to that notice, and  (c)  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Secretary  of  State  or  the  immigration officer, there is no satisfactory reason for that matter not having been raised in a statement made in response to that notice.” The expressions “asylum claim” and “human rights claim” are each defined   12. in section 113(1). It provides:   “In this Part, unless a contrary intention appears –  “asylum claim” means a claim made by a person to the Secretary of State at a place designated by the Secretary of State that to remove the  person  from  or  to  require  him  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom would  breach  the  United  Kingdom’s  obligations  under  the  Refugee Convention, … “human  rights  claim”  means  a  claim  made  by  a  person  to  the Secretary of State at a place designated by the Secretary of State that to  remove  the  person  from  or  to  require  him  to  leave  the  United Kingdom  would  be  unlawful  under  section  6  of  the  Human  Rights Act 1998 (c. 42) (public authority not to act contrary to Convention) as being incompatible with his Convention rights”    Section  12  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006  amends  those definitions prospectively by adding in each case a provision that the expression:   “does  not  include  a  claim  which,  having  regard  to  a  former  claim, falls  to  be  disregarded  for  the  purposes  of  this  Part  in  accordance with the immigration rules.”   As  Sedley  LJ  observed  in  the  Court  of  Appeal,  under  this  amended  formula  a claim in any case where an earlier challenge to removal has been made and failed will  only  rank  as  an  asylum  claim  or  a  human  rights  claim  if  it  is  a  fresh  claim under  rule  353:  [2009]  2  WLR  1370,  para  27.  The  amendment  has  not  yet  been brought into force, as the entire system of immigration law is now under review. A Green  Paper  containing  proposals  to  simplify  the  law  was  published  in  February  Page 7 \\x0c     2008, and it is expected that a Bill to simplify the law will be published towards the end of this year.    13.  No certificates under either section 94 or section 96 have been issued to the respondent  in  either  case.  They  maintain  that  in  these  circumstances  they  are entitled to have their appeals heard in-country under section 92(4)(a), and that they cannot be removed from the United Kingdom until their appeals have been dealt with. The Secretary of State’s contention is that an appeal against an immigration decision  is  available  only  out  of  country  where,  as  in  BA’s  case,  the  further representations have not been advanced as a fresh claim or, as in PE’s case, have not been accepted as such by the Secretary of State. He maintains that their appeals must  now  be  pursued  out  of  country.  If  so,  there  is  now  no  obstacle  to  the respondents  being  deported  in  accordance  with  the  deportation  orders  that  have been served on them.      The competing arguments in more detail   14. For  the  Secretary  of  State  Miss  Laing  QC  did  not  dispute  that  a  right  of appeal arises under section 82(1) when a decision that is an immigration decision is  taken.  Nor  does  she  dispute  that  the  Secretary  of  State’s  refusal  in  these  cases not  to  revoke  the  deportation  orders  were  immigration  decisions  within  the meaning of section 82(2)(k) of the 2002 Act. What was in issue was whether the right of appeal against those decisions was to be exercised from within the United Kingdom. Her submission was that the words “an asylum claim, or a human rights claim” in section 92(4)(a) mean a first asylum or human rights claim or a second or  subsequent  asylum  or  human  rights  claim  which  has  been  accepted  as  a  fresh claim under rule 353 of the Immigration Rules.     15. She acknowledged that this was not the literal meaning of this provision, as the definitions of these expressions made no reference to the fact that the claims to which they referred had to be a first or a fresh claim. But she said that they had to be construed in the context of the scheme of the statute as a whole, and that they had to be read in the way she suggested to avoid an absurdity. She submitted that the  authorities  also  showed  that  they  had  to  be  read  subject  to  this  qualification. She  based  this  submission  on  two  decisions  of  the  Court  of  Appeal:  Cakabay  v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (Nos  2  and  3)  [1999]  Imm  AR  176 and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Onibiyo [1996] QB 768. In each of these cases observations were made about the treatment of repeat claims for  asylum  in  the  context  of  the  provisions  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration Appeals Act 1993.            Page 8 \\x0c      In  Cakabay  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (Nos  2  and  3) 16. [1999] Imm AR 176, 180-181, Schiemann LJ said:   “The statute makes no express provision as to what is to be done in the  case  of  repeated  claims  for  asylum  by  the  same  person.  The second  claim  may  be  identical  to  the  first  (‘a  repetitious  claim’)  or may be different (‘a fresh claim’). It is common ground that a fresh claim attracts all the substantive and procedural consequences of an initial claim whereas a repetitious claim does not.   In the case of a repetitious claim no more is required to be done: the first  decision  has  ensured  that  the  United  Kingdom  has  complied with its obligations under the Convention. Section 6 of the 1993 Act creates  no  inhibition  on  the  claimant’s  removal:  the  Secretary  of State  has  on  the  occasion  of  his  decision  on  the  first  claim  decided the  repetitious  claim.  So  far  as  the  decision  on  the  claimant’s repetitious  application  for  leave  to  enter  is  concerned,  the  claimant will be told that leave has already been refused and that there is no need for any new decision.”   17. In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Onibiyo [1996] QB 768  the  court  had  to  consider  whether,  as  a  matter  of  law,  a  person  might  make more than one “claim for asylum” within the meaning of section 6 of the 1993 Act during a single uninterrupted stay in the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State argued  that,  once  a  person  had  made  a  claim  for  asylum,  had  had  that  claim refused  and  had  unsuccessfully  exercised  his  rights  of  appeal  under  section  9  of that  Act,  his  legal  rights  were  exhausted.  There  could  be  no  further  claim  for asylum unless the claimant left the United Kingdom and returned before making a fresh application. At p 781 Sir Thomas Bingham MR rejected that argument. He said that it would undermine the beneficial object of the Convention if the making of  an  unsuccessful  application  for  asylum  were  to  be  treated  as  modifying  the obligation  of  the  United  Kingdom  or  depriving  a  person  of  the  right  to  make  a fresh “claim for asylum”. He then discussed what constituted a fresh claim. At pp 783-784  he  said  that  the  acid  test  must  always  be  whether,  comparing  the  new claim  with  that  which  had  been  rejected,  and  excluding  material  on  which  the claimant could reasonably be expected to rely in the earlier claim, the new claim was sufficiently different from the earlier claim to admit of a realistic prospect that a  favourable  view  could  be  taken  of  the  new  claim  despite  the  unfavourable conclusion reached on the earlier claim.     18.  Miss Laing said that the same approach should be taken to the words used in section 92(4)(a) of the 2002 Act. She submitted that the intention of Parliament  Page 9 \\x0c     when  enacting  this  provision  had  to  be  derived  from  the  context,  the  legislative history  and  the  requirements  of  the  international  instruments.  The  essential features of the 2002 Act remained the same as those in the 1993 Act. It was to be assumed  that  where  the  same  words  were  used  they  were  intended  to  have  the same meaning. It was implicit in the approach that was taken in Ex p Onibiyo that the  Convention  did  not  require  protection  against  removal  if  all  that  the  further representations  were  doing  was  to  repeat  an  earlier  claim  which  had  been considered and rejected on appeal. What the international instruments required was compliance, not redundancy. It was only a fresh claim that would be an obstacle to the claimant’s removal, by converting what would otherwise be an out of country appeal into an appeal that must be dealt with in-country.     19.  As  for  the  prospective  amendment  of  section  113,  she  said  that  it  did  two things. It removed the requirement that a claim be made “at a place designated by the Secretary of State”. And it clarified what section 113 should be taken to have meant  on  enactment.  In  the  words  of  the  Explanatory  Notes,  its  purpose  is  to “clarify that further submissions which follow the refusal of an asylum or human rights claim but which do not amount to a fresh claim will not carry a further right of appeal.” But it was of no assistance in resolving the argument either way as to the meaning of the definitions in their current form. Lloyd LJ was right when he said in the Court of Appeal that the amendment should be ignored: [2009] 2 WLR 1370, para 35.      20.  Mr  Husain  too  submitted  that  the  meaning  of  the  words  used  in  section 94(2)(a)  must  be  understood  from  their  context. But he said that  the  context  was markedly different from that in the 1993 Act. There was now a series of statutory provisions  against  abuse  which  were  not  to  be  found  in  the  earlier  legislation.  It was those provisions, and not those instituted under the Immigration Rules by the executive, that should be used if it was thought that the appeals should not be dealt with  in-country.  The  Secretary  of  State’s  approach  rendered  the  new  provisions otiose and unworkable in the case of second claims.     21. For  example,  Parliament  had  provided  by  section  84(1)(g)  that  an  appeal against  an  immigration  decision  might  be  taken  on  the  ground  that  the  person’s removal from the United Kingdom would breach the State’s obligations under the Refugee  Convention.  Section  84(1)(c)  dealt  with  the  situation  where  it  was contended that the decision was unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  But  the  rights  conferred  by  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights were,  in  various  respects,  not  the  same:  JM  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home Department [2006] EWCA Civ 1402; [2007] Imm AR 293, para 27, per Laws LJ. If the Secretary of State was right that the appeal could only be taken in-country if it was certified under rule 353, the person would be forced to take his appeal out of country  even  although  it  was  on  grounds  referred  to  in  section  84(1)(g),  which  Page 10 \\x0c     could be different from those advanced at an earlier stage under section 84(1)(c). As he would be without a certificate under section 94, he would be deprived of the benefit of section 94(9).   22.  As for what was said in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Onibiyo, Mr Husain said that it was not the only relevant authority. Prior to the enactment  of  the  2002  Act  there  were  two  other  important  decisions  to  which reference  should  be  made.  In  R  (Kariharan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home Department [2002] EWCA Civ 1102, [2003] QB 933, reference was made to the one-stop procedure that was introduced by sections 74-77 of the Immigration and Asylum  Act  1999  and  to  section  73  of  that  Act,  which  enabled  the  Secretary  of State to certify that a claim that a decision of a decision-maker was in breach of the appellant’s  human  rights  could  reasonably  have  been  made  earlier,  the  effect  of which  was  that  the  appeal  was  to  be  treated  as  finally  determined:  see  Auld  LJ, para 30. In para 36 Sedley LJ said that those provisions gave ample powers to the Secretary of State to dispose summarily of repetitive and abusive appeals. In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Saleem [2001] 1 WLR 443, 449, Roche LJ accepted that the right of appeal to an independent appellate body was a fundamental  or  basic  right  akin  to  the  right  of  unimpeded  access  to  a  court,  an infringement of which must be either expressly authorised by or arise by necessary implication from an Act of Parliament.   23. Furthermore  the  approach  that  was  taken  in  R  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the Home  Department,  ex  p  Onibiyo  to  the  problem  of  repeat  claims  was  imprecise and had been rendered unnecessary by the current legislation. In that case, as Sir Thomas Bingham MR recorded at p 783, counsel for the applicant, Mr Blake QC, as  he  then  was,  had  conceded  that  that  a  fresh  “claim  for  asylum”  could  not  be made by advancing, even with some elaboration or addition, a claim already made or by relying on evidence available to the applicant but not advanced at the time of an earlier claim.  A similar concession was made in Manvinder Singh v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1995] EWCA Civ 53, where Stuart-Smith LJ noted  that  in  his  skeleton  argument  Mr  Blake  QC  had  accepted  that  Parliament could  not  have  intended  removal  to  be  indefinitely  deferred  pending  successive identical  appeals.  The  observations  in  Ex  p  Onibiyo  had  been  inspired  by  the possibility  of  abuse.  The  contours  of  the  legislation  had  now  changed.  The opportunity  to  resolve  the  issue  by  bringing  the  amendment  of  the  definitions  in section 113 into force had not been taken. It was difficult to understand why, if its purpose  was  simply  to  clarify,  it  had  not  been  brought  into  force.  As  it  was,  the legislation  had  to  be  taken  as  it  stood  without  regard  to  what  may  have  been contemplated by the amendment.      Discussion   Page 11 \\x0c     24. I have set out the competing arguments at some length, partly out of respect for the excellent submissions that were advanced by counsel on either side in the Chamber of the House of Lords on the occasion of the last sitting of the House in its judicial capacity, and partly because they demonstrate very clearly the essence of  the  issue  that  we  must  decide.  Miss  Laing  invites  us  to  follow  Sir  Thomas Bingham  MR’s  analysis  of  the  problem  in  R  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home Department,  ex  p  Onibiyo,  to  hold  that  the  words  “an asylum  claim,  or  a  human rights  claim”  in  section  92(4)(a)  of  the  2002  Act  mean  a  first  asylum  or  human rights  claim  or  a  second  or  subsequent  claim  which  has  been  accepted  by  the Secretary  of  State  as  a  “fresh  claim”,  and  that  the  procedure  for  determining whether or not a second or subsequent claim is a fresh claim is to be found in rule 353 of the Immigration Rules. Mr Husain on the other hand invites us to examine those  words  in  the  context  of  the  current  legislation  read  as  a  whole,  taking  full account of the progress of thinking since Ex p Onibiyo as to how the problem of repeat claims should be addressed. He submits that there is no justification, in the light  of  the  provisions  for  dealing  with  repeat  claims  that  the  2002  Act  contains, for enlarging upon the plain words of the statute.     25. The strength of Miss Laing’s argument lies in the fact that the definition of the phrase “claim for asylum” has remained, in substance, the same since its first appearance in section 1 of the 1993 Act where it was said to mean –    “a claim made by a person (whether before or after the coming into force  of  this  section)  that  it  would  be  contrary  to  the  United Kingdom’s obligations under the Convention for him to be removed from, or required to leave, the United Kingdom”.   The  Convention  there  referred  to  was,  of  course,  the  Refugee  Convention.  The definition  in  section  167  of  the  1999  Act  was  in  substantially  the  same  terms. Section  113  of  the  2002  Act  varies  the  language  a  little  bit,  because  it  calls  this kind of claim “an asylum claim”, introduces a requirement for it to be made at a place designated by the Secretary of State (no such place has been designated) and adds a definition in almost identical terms of “a human rights claim”. The relevant phrase throughout is “a claim”.     26. In  R  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department,  ex  p  Onibiyo  the Secretary of State’s argument that once there had been a claim for asylum and one appeal there could be no further “claim for asylum” unless the claimant had left the United Kingdom and returned before making the fresh application was rejected. It was  held  that  there  could  be  a  fresh  “claim  for  asylum”  with  the  same consequences as to the right of appeal as follow on the refusal of an initial claim, provided  that  the  Secretary  of  State  recognised  the  fresh  claim  as  a  “claim  for  Page 12 \\x0c     asylum”.  If  one  looks  no  further  and  applies  what  Bennion  on  Statutory Interpretation (5th ed, 2008), section 201 and Part XIV described as “the informed interpretation  rule”,  there  is  plainly  much  to  be  said  for  the  view  that  the definitions  that  are  set  out  in  section  113  of  the  2002  Act  should  be  read  in  the same  way.  The  procedure  for  determining  whether  a  repeat  claim  is  or  is  not  a “fresh claim” is set out in rule 353 of the Immigration Rules, the effect of which I attempted to explain in Z T (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] 1 WLR 348, para 33. It is a short step to conclude that a repeat claim which is not held under rule 353 to be a fresh claim falls to be disregarded as “an asylum claim,  or  a  human  rights  claim”  for  the purposes  of  section  92(4)(a).  Like  Lloyd LJ, I would not draw an inference either way from the amendment of section 113 by section 12 of the 2006 Act as it is not yet in force.   27. It is an elementary principle, however, that the words of a statute should be construed in the context of the scheme of the statute as a whole. And it is plain that the scheme of the 2002 Act is not the same as that of the 1993 Act to which Sir Thomas Bingham MR addressed himself in Ex p Onibiyo. The problem to which he addressed himself was created by the absence of any provision in the statute to prevent abuse. The question was how that gap might best be filled, having regard to  the  fact  that  the  blunt  solution  that  was  proposed  by  the  Secretary  of  State would, as the Master of the Rolls pointed out at p 781, undermine the beneficial object of the Convention and the measures giving effect to it in this country.     28. Parliament might, of course, have stood still and left the matter to be dealt with under the Immigration Rules. But it has not stood still. The experience of the intervening  years  has  been  taken  into  account.  First,  there  were  the  provisions against abuse in sections 73 to 77 of the 1999 Act. Now there is a set of entirely new  provisions  in  the  2002  Act.  As  Lord  Hoffmann  said  in  A  v  Hoare  [2008] UKHL  6,  [2008]  1  AC  844,  para  15,  while  there  is  a  good  deal  of  authority  for having regard in the construction of a statute to the way a word or phrase has been construed by the court in earlier statutes, the value of such previous interpretation as a guide to construction will vary with the circumstances. In this case the phrase in question has remained, in essence, unchanged. But the system in which it must be made to work is very different.  This is a factor to which full weight must be given.   29. The  new  system  contains  a  range  of  powers  that  enable  the  Secretary  of State  or,  as  the  case  may  be,  an  immigration  officer  to  deal  with  the  problem  of repeat claims.  The Secretary of State’s power in section 94(2) of the 2002 Act to certify that a claim is clearly unfounded, if exercised, has the effect that the person may  not  bring  his  appeal  in-country  in  reliance  on  section  92(4).  The  power  in section 96 enables the Secretary of State or an immigration officer to certify that a person who is subject to a new immigration decision has raised an issue which has  Page 13 \\x0c     been  dealt  with,  or  ought  to  have  been  dealt  with,  in  an  earlier  appeal  against  a previous  immigration  decision,  which  has  the  effect  that  the  person  will  have  no right  of  appeal  against  the  new  decision.  It  is  common  ground  that  the  present cases are not certifiable under either of these two sections. Why then should they be subjected to a further requirement which is not mentioned anywhere in the 2002 Act? It can only be read into the Act by, as Sedley LJ in the Court of Appeal put it, glossing  the  meaning  of  the  words  “a…claim”  so  as  to  exclude  a  further  claim which has not been held under rule 353 to be a fresh claim: [2009] 2 WLR 1370, paras 20, 30. The court had to do this in Ex p Onibiyo.  But there is no need to do this now.   30. It is not just that there is no need now to read those words into the statute.  As  Mr  Husain  pointed  out,  the  two  systems  for  excluding  repeat  claims  are  not compatible. Take the system that section 94 lays down for dealing with claims that the Secretary of State considers to be clearly unfounded. If he issues a certificate to that effect, the appeal must be pursued out of country. But the claimant will have the  benefit  of  section  94(9),  which  provides  that  where  a  person  in  relation  to whom a certificate under that section subsequently brings an appeal under section 82(1) while outside the United Kingdom the appeal will be considered as if he had not been removed from the United Kingdom. He will have the benefit too of the passage in parenthesis in section 95, which provides:   “A person who is outside the United Kingdom may not appeal under section 82(1) on the ground specified in section 84(1)(g) (except in a case to which section 94(9) applies).”   31. If Miss Laing is right, the effect of a decision by the Secretary of State that the representations that a person makes against an immigration decision of the kind mentioned in section 82(1)(k) – a refusal to revoke a deportation order – is not a fresh  claim  will  be  that  an  appeal  against  that  decision  must  be  brought  out  of country.  But  the  interpretative  route  by  which  she  reaches  that  position  does  not save that person from the exclusionary rule in section 95, unless – which has not been  done  in  these  cases  –  the  claims  are  also  certified  under  section  94(2)  as clearly unfounded. The ground of appeal referred to in section 84(1)(g) has been designed  to  honour  the  international  obligations  of  the  United  Kingdom.  To exclude claims which the Secretary of State considers not to be fresh claims from this  ground  of  appeal,  when  claims  which  he  certifies  as  clearly  unfounded  are given  the  benefit  of  it,  can  serve  no  good  purpose.  On  the  contrary,  it  risks undermining the beneficial objects of the Refugee Convention which the court in Onibiyo,  under  a  legislative  system  which  had  no  equivalent  to  section  95,  was careful to avoid.      Page 14 \\x0c     32. In  my  opinion  Lloyd  LJ  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  was  right  to  attach importance  to  this  point:  [2009]  2  WLR  1370,  paras  39-40.  As  he  said,  the development of the legislative provisions and the powers given to the Secretary of State to limit the scope for in country appeals deprive Miss Laing’s submissions of the  foundation  which  they  need.  There  is  obviously  a  balance  to  be  struck.  The immigration  appeals  system  must  not  be  burdened  with  worthless  repeat  claims. On the other hand, procedures that are put in place to address this problem must respect the United Kingdom’s international obligations. That is what the legislative scheme does, when section 95 is read together with section 94(9). It preserves the right  to  maintain  in  an  out  of  country  appeal  that  the  decision  in  question  has breached international obligations. I would hold that claims which are not certified under  section  94  or  excluded  under  section  96,  if  rejected,  should  be  allowed  to proceed  to  appeal  in-country  under  sections  82  and  92,  whether  or  not  they  are accepted by the Secretary of State as fresh claims.     33. There is no doubt, as I indicated in Z T (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department [2009] 1 WLR 348, para 33, that  rule  353  was  drafted  on  the assumption  that  a  claimant  who  made  further  submissions  would  be  at  risk  of being  removed  or  required  to  leave  immediately  if  he  does  not  have  a  “fresh claim”.  That  was  indeed  the  case  when  this  rule  was  originally  drafted,  as  there was no equivalent of section 92(4) of the 2002 Act. But Mr Husain’s analysis has persuaded me that the legislative scheme that Parliament has now put in place does not have that effect. Its carefully interlocking provisions, when read as a whole, set out  the  complete  code  for  dealing  with  repeat  claims.  Rule  353,  as  presently drafted, has no part to play in the legislative scheme. As an expression of the will of  Parliament,  it  must  take  priority  over  the  rules  formulated  by  the  executive. Rule  353A  on  the  other  hand  remains  in  place  as  necessary  protection  against premature  removal  until  the  further  submissions  have  been  considered  by  the Secretary of State.                             Conclusion   34. Appeal.                                I would dismiss these appeals and affirm the orders made by the Court of  Page 15 \\x0c      LORD SCOTT   35. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Lord Hope and am persuaded that for the reasons he has given these appeals should be dismissed. I  am  in  full  agreement  also  with  the  comments  made  by  Lord  Brown  whose judgment I have also had the advantage of reading in draft.   LORD RODGER  I  agree  with  the  judgment  of  Lord  Hope  and  with  the  additional 36. observations of Lord Brown.   37. The  submission  for  the  Home  Secretary  that  the  expression  “an  asylum claim”  in  section  92(4)(a)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002 should be given the same meaning as Sir Thomas Bingham gave to the expression “a  claim  for  asylum”  in  section  6  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Appeals  Act 1993  is  at  first  sight  compelling.  Certainly,  the  change  in  the  form  of  the expression is irrelevant. The contexts within which the two expressions have to be interpreted  are,  however,  relevant.  And,  as  Lord  Hope  explains,  they  are significantly different, since the 2002 Act contains a new scheme for dealing with abusive claims. Given that new scheme, there is no longer the same need to adopt the  former  interpretation  and,  indeed,  the  one  now  adopted  fits  the  new  context better.    LADY HALE   38. I  am  afraid  that  I  have  reached  a  different  conclusion  from  the  other members  of  the  Court.  There  is  no  need  to  explain  my  views  in  detail  as  it  will make no difference to the result.   39.  We are concerned with the meaning of the word “claim” in section 92(4)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. When that Act was passed, it had been understood since 1996 that in this context the word “claim” referred to a  first  claim,  or  to  a  second  or  subsequent  claim  which  was  different  from  any earlier claim, but not to a second or subsequent claim which was merely repetitious of  an  earlier  claim.  This  eminently  sensible  conclusion  had  been  reached  by  a Court of Appeal led by Sir Thomas Bingham MR in R v Secretary of State for the  Page 16 \\x0c     Home Department, ex parte Onibiyo [1996] QB 768. It is a well-known principle of  statutory  interpretation  that  when  Parliament  re-enacts  words  which  have already been the subject of judicial interpretation it intends them to have the same meaning. There was no need, therefore, for Parliament to spell out what it meant by a “claim” in section 92(4)(a). It was already well-known.     40. In  Onibiyo  the  Court  also  considered  whether  the  decision  that  a  “claim” was a “claim” was a question of precedent fact for the court to decide or a question for  the  Secretary  of  State  to  decide  subject  to  challenge  on  the  usual  judicial review grounds. It was not necessary to decide this question in that case, but the Master of the Rolls “inclined” to the latter view. This was adopted by the Court of Appeal  in  later  cases:  see  eg  WM  (DRC)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home Department [2006] EWCA Civ 1495, [2007] Imm A R 337; R (AK) (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 447. Rule 353 of the  Immigration  Rules  sets  out  the  test  which  the  Secretary  of  State  applies  in making  his  decision.  It  should  not  be  thought,  however,  that  Miss  Laing’s argument  depends  upon  the  existence  and  wording  of  rule  353.  That  merely provides for how the Secretary of State reaches his decision as to whether or not a claim  is  a  “claim”.  It  is  not  the  end  of  the  matter.  The  Secretary  of  State’s  test might come under attack for not reflecting the “acid test” laid down by the Master of the Rolls in Onibiyo. His conclusion reached in an individual case might come under attack on Wednesbury or other conventional grounds. The conclusion of the Court of Appeal, that this is not a question of precedent fact, to be determined by the  appellate  authorities  and  ultimately  by  the  courts,  might  be  challenged  in  the Supreme  Court.    Miss  Laing’s  argument  is  simply  that  when  Parliament  enacted section 92(4)(a) of the 2002 Act it thought that the meaning of “an asylum claim, or a human rights claim,” was already well established and did not include a claim which was merely repetitious of an earlier one. She is not relying on rule 353 to construe the 2002 Act.   41. I  am  not  persuaded  by  Mr  Husain’s  argument,  attractively  though  it  was put, that the new powers under sections 94 and 96 to restrict or deny appeals put such an entirely new complexion on matters that Parliament is to be taken to have abandoned  the  old  meaning  of  “claim”  without  saying  so.  This  would  be astonishing given that it is apparently common ground that neither of these claims would have been certifiable under either section. Section 94 removes the right of in-country  (but  not  out-country)  appeal  if  an  asylum  or  human  rights  claim  is “clearly  unfounded”.  Yet  apparently  it  is  not  suggested  that  the  fact  that  a  claim has  been  made  previously  and  rejected  necessarily  means  that  it  is  “clearly unfounded”.  Section  96  removes  the  right  of  appeal  altogether  if  a  claim  or application  raises  matters  which  could  have  been  raised  on  an  appeal  against  an earlier  decision.  This  does  not  deal  with  a  claim  which  raises  exactly  the  same matters as were rejected on an earlier occasion. So it is common ground that these new powers are not apt to cater for repetitious claims. If so, I cannot understand  Page 17 \\x0c     how  Parliament,  by  introducing  them,  can  be  taken  to  have  departed  from  an established interpretation which was designed to deal with a different problem.    42.  Nor  am  I  persuaded  by  the  argument  that,  if  an  asylum  or  human  rights claim is certified under section 94, the claimant can still raise his asylum or human rights  arguments  in  an  out-of-country  appeal,  but  that  otherwise  section  95 prevents a person from raising asylum or human rights grounds from outside the country. A person whose claim is certified under section 94 is denied any right of appeal  in  this  country,  but  may  appeal  from  outside.  It  is  only  right  in  those circumstances that he should be able to appeal on the same grounds that he could have  raised  in  this  country.  A  person  whose  claim  is  not  a  claim  at  all,  because essentially the same claim has already been determined, has already enjoyed rights of appeal on asylum or human rights grounds in this country. There is no reason to give him a second bite at the cherry whether here or abroad.   43. This country is bound not to expel people in breach of their human rights or when they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country. We must of  course  have  a  fair  system  for  deciding whether expulsion will be in breach of those obligations. An initial decision followed by an appeal system in this country is  sufficient  to  do  this.  This  country  is  not  bound  to  allow  people  to  make essentially  the  same  claim  time  and  time  again  as  a  way  of  staving  off  their departure.  The  interpretation  put  forward  by  Miss  Laing  accords  with  our international  obligations,  as  well  as  with  principle  and  practicality.  I  would  have allowed this appeal.       LORD BROWN   44. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Lord Hope and am  in  full  agreement  with  him  that  these  appeals  should  be  dismissed.  I  would make it clear, however, that this is not a conclusion at which I readily arrived and I reached it only on the basis that, as Mr Husain in his enticing submissions readily accepted, the statutory solution to the problem of abuse created by the making of repeat asylum claims lies not in construing “an asylum claim” in section 92(4)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as the Court of Appeal in R v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  ex  parte  Onibiyo  [1996]  QB  768 construed  “a  claim  for  asylum”  in  section  6  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration Appeals  Act  1993  but  rather  in  the  Secretary  of  State  issuing  certificates  where appropriate  under  sections  94  or  96  of  the  2002  Act  (no  equivalent  provisions having been available under the 1993 Act).   Page 18 \\x0c     45. True it is, as observed by Lord Hope in paragraph 29 of his judgment (and noted also at paragraph 13 of Sedley LJ’s judgment in the Court of Appeal [2009] 2 WLR 1370), that it is common ground between the parties that the present cases are not certifiable under either of these sections. That, however, as I understand it, is  solely  because,  so  far  as  section  94  is  concerned,  it  applies  only  “where  the appellant has made an asylum claim or a human rights claim (or both)” (subsection 1).  By  the  same  token  that,  on  the  Secretary  of  State’s  argument,  a  repeat  claim does not fall within those words in section 92 (4)(a), so he contends that it does not do so for section 94 purposes. Given, however, as Mr Husain submits and I would accept, that a repeat claim does involve making a claim for the purposes of section 92(4)(a), so too it enables the Secretary of State to certify it as “clearly unfounded” if he so regards it under section 94. Moreover,  consistently  with what the House said in ZT (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] 1 WLR 348 (Lord Neuberger’s views expressed at paragraphs 80-81 of his opinion being determinative  on  this  point),  there  will  be  precious  few  cases  in  which  that  test differs  from  the  rule  353  test  as  to  whether  a  claim  has  “a  realistic  prospect  of success”.   46. The  major  reason  why  finally  I  am  persuaded  that  the  respondent’s approach  is  the  correct  one  is  that,  so  far  from  leaving  the  critical  words  “an asylum  claim”  in  section  92(4)(a)  to  be  construed  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  in Onibiyo  construed  “a  claim  for  asylum”  in  the 1993  Act,  Parliament  in  the  2002 Act  not  only  made  express  provisions  to  deal  with  abusive  claims  but  split  up different  aspects  of  the  possible  abuse  between  sections  94  and  96.  Sir  Thomas Bingham MR in Onibiyo had said (at pp783-784):   “The  acid  test  must  always  be  whether,  comparing  the  new  claim with  that  earlier  rejected,  and  excluding  material  on  which  the claimant  could  reasonably  have  been  expected  to  rely  in  the  earlier claim, the new claim is sufficiently different from the earlier claim to admit of a realistic prospect that a favourable view could be taken of the  new  claim  despite  the  unfavourable  conclusion  reached  on  the earlier claim.”   “[Ex]cluding material on which the claimant could reasonably have been expected to rely in the earlier claim” is now expressly dealt with by section 96. As already explained, ordinary repeat claims fall to be excluded under section 94.    47.  As  Lord  Hope  points  out,  moreover,  there  is  one  very  clear  advantage  in providing  for  any  abuse  by  making  repeat  claims  to  be  dealt  with  by  section  94 rather than rule 353: by virtue of sections 94(9), 95 and 84(1)(g) it allows an out of  Page 19 \\x0ccountry appeal to be brought on human rights grounds when otherwise that would not be possible.   48. Hope’s altogether fuller judgment, I too would dismiss these appeals. For  these  reasons,  therefore,  which  in  large  part  echo  those  given  in  Lord                   Page 20'}, 'press summary': {'Press summary': '26 November 2009  BA (Nigeria) (FC) (Respondent) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Appellant) & Ors;  PE  (Cameroon)  (FC)  (Respondent)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department (Appellant) (Consolidated Appeals) [2009] UKSC 7  On appeal from the Court of Appeal Civil Division [2009] EWCA Civ 119', 'Justices': 'Lord Hope (Deputy President), Lord Scott, Lord Rodger, Lady Hale and Lord Brown', 'Background to the appeal': 'BA  and  PE  were  each  served  a  deportation  order  after  unsuccessful  appeals  on  human  rights  and asylum grounds against the decision to deport them. Both unsuccessfully made further submissions to the Secretary of State in an attempt to have the order revoked. They then applied to judicially review the  decision  not  to  revoke  the  deportation  order,  maintaining  that  their  removal  from  the  United Kingdom would be in breach of their human rights. (Paras [3]-[5])   This appeal concerns whether, once a claimant has had his appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State determined, he can make another appeal in-country on the same grounds which were rejected on the  earlier  occasion.  The  Secretary  of  State  argued  that  a  repetitive  claim  did  not  fall  within  section 92(4)(a)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  which  provides  for  an  in-country appeal where the claimant has made “an asylum claim, or a human rights claim” whilst in the UK. The Secretary of State argued that where, as in BA’s case, further representations have not been advanced as a fresh claim as defined under rule 353 of the Immigration Rules, or, as in PE’s case, have not been accepted as such by the Secretary of State, they can only be considered out of country and that there is no obstacle to the deportations. (Paras [8]; [13]-[15])', 'Judgment': 'The appeal by the Secretary of State is dismissed by a majority of four to one. A claim for asylum which has been rejected should be allowed to proceed to appeal in-country under sections 82 and 92 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, unless it has been certified as clearly unfounded under section 94 or excluded under section 96. This should be so  whether  or  not  the  Secretary  of  State  has  accepted  it  as  a  fresh  claim. (Paragraph [32])  Lord  Hope  gave  the majority judgment of the Court. Lady Hale dissented.', 'Reasons for the judgment': '\\uf0b7  Lord Hope considered the phrase “an asylum claim, or a human rights claim” in s 92(4)(a) in the context of the 2002 Act as a whole and rejected the Appellant’s argument that the Supreme Court should follow the interpretation in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Onibiyo [1996] QB  768.  In Onibiyo,  “claim”  in  the  context  of  the  1993  Act was  held  to  mean  a  first  claim,  or  a second or subsequent claim which has been accepted as a “fresh claim” by the Secretary of State, but  not  a  claim  which  is  repetitious.  Lord  Hope  determined  that  whilst  the  2002  Act  uses substantially the same words as the 1993 Act, the statutory system is markedly different given the The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.gov.uk   \\x0c\\uf0b7 addition of a range of powers enabling the Secretary of State or immigration officer to deal with repetitious  claims.  No  inference  was  drawn  from  the  amendment  of  s  113  by  s  12  of  the Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006  as  it  is  not  yet  in  force.  (Paras  [25]-[29];  [44]–[46]) In a case such as this where no certification has been given under s 94 (providing for the exclusion of appeals that are clearly unfounded) or s 96 (removing the right of appeal if the claim raises an issue  which  has  been  or  ought  to  have  been  dealt  with  in  an  earlier  appeal),  there  is  no  need  to impose a further requirement which is not mentioned elsewhere in the 2002 Act, namely that the words “a…claim”  exclude a further  claim which has not been held under rule 353 to be a fresh claim. (Para [29]) \\uf0b7  The Appellant’s construction risks undermining the beneficial objects of the Refugee Convention, as it would exclude, by s 95, claims which the Secretary of State considers not to be fresh claims from  the  ground  of  appeal  in  s  84(1)(g),  when  claims  which  are  certified  as  clearly  unfounded under s 94 would still be given the benefit of that section. (Section 84(1)(g) provides for an appeal where  removal  would  place  the  UK  in  breach  of  its  international  or  human  rights  obligations.) (Paras [30]–[32]; [47]) \\uf0b7  Rule 353 does not affect the operation of the legislative scheme, which provides the complete code for dealing with repeat claims. (Para [33])  Lady Hale, dissenting, would have allowed the appeal. \\uf0b7  Lady Hale concluded “a…claim” in s 92(4)(a) of the 2002 Act ought to be given the same meaning ascribed  to the phrase in the 1993 Act  in  Onibiyo. There was no need for it to be defined in the 2002  Act  given  it  had  already  been  judicially  interpreted.  (Paras  [39]–[40])  The  addition  of sections 94 and 96 should not be taken to mean that Parliament had abandoned the old meaning of “claim” without expressly saying so, particularly as the additional sections are not apt to cater for repetitious claims. (Paras [41]–[42]) \\uf0b7  Lady  Hale  disagreed  that  the  Appellant’s  construction  would  undermine  the  UK’s  international obligations. A person who presents a repeat claim on asylum or human rights grounds has already enjoyed the right of appeal on these grounds within this country. The current system allowing for an  initial  decision  followed  by  an  appeal  system  in  the  UK  is  sufficient  compliance  with  those obligations.

For  this  he  needs  B’s  consent:  unsurprisingly,  A  is  bound  by  strict  contractual obligations as well as duties of confidentiality and statutory obligations under the Official  Secrets  Act  1989.  On  14  August  2007,  after  lengthy  top  secret correspondence  (and  following  final  consideration  by  the  Director  General),  B refused  to  authorise  publication  of  parts  of  the  manuscript.  The  correspondence (and  annexures)  described  in  detail  the  Security  Services’s  national  security objections  to  disclosure.  On  13  November  2007  A  commenced  judicial  review proceedings to challenge B’s decision. He claims that it was unreasonable, vitiated by bias and contrary to article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the  right  to  freedom  of  expression.  Is such a challenge, however, one that A can bring in the courts or can it be brought only in the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (the  IPT)?    That  is  the  issue  now  before  the  Court  and  it  is  one  which  depends principally  upon  the  true  construction  of  section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Regulation  of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA):    “(2) The jurisdiction of the Tribunal shall be – (a)  to  be  the  only  appropriate  tribunal  for  the  purposes  of section  7  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  in  relation  to  any proceedings  under section (proceedings for actions incompatible with Convention rights) which fall within subsection (3) of this section;” subsection (1)(a)  of that   Subsection (3) provides that proceedings fall within this section if –   “(a) they are proceedings against any of the intelligence services;”   2. Collins J decided that the Administrative Court had jurisdiction to hear A’s challenge:  [2008]  4  All  ER  511  (4  July  2008).  The  Court  of  Appeal  (Laws  and Dyson  LJJ,  Rix  LJ  dissenting)  reversed  that  decision,  holding  that  exclusive jurisdiction lies with the IPT: [2009] 3 WLR 717 (18 February 2009).   3. Before  turning  to  the  rival  contentions  it  is  convenient  to  set  out  the legislative provisions most central to the arguments advanced. The Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) by section 7 provides:   Page 2 \\x0c     “(1)  A  person  who  claims  that  a  public  authority  has  acted  (or proposes  to  act)  in  a  way  which  is  made  unlawful  by  section  6(1) may –  (a)  bring  proceedings  against  the  authority  under  this  Act  in  the appropriate court or tribunal, or  (b)  rely  on  the  Convention  right  or  rights  concerned  in  any  legal proceedings,   but only if he is (or would be) a victim of the unlawful act.  (2)  In subsection (1) (a) ‘appropriate court or tribunal’ means such court or tribunal as may be determined in accordance with rules; and proceedings  against  an  authority  include  a  counterclaim  or  similar proceeding.    . . .  (9)  In this section ‘rules’ means –  (a)  in  relation  to  proceedings  before  a  court  or  tribunal  outside Scotland, rules made by . . . the Lord Chancellor or the Secretary of State for the purposes of this section or rules of court.”   Pursuant  to  section  7(9),  CPR  7.11  (introduced,  like  HRA,  with  effect  from  2 October 2000) provides:   “(1)  A claim under section 7(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998 in respect of a judicial act may be brought only in the High Court. (2)  Any  other  claim  under  section  7(1)(a)  of  that  Act  may  be brought in any court.”    4. The  only  tribunals  upon  whom  section  7(1)(a)  HRA  jurisdiction  has  been conferred  by  rules  made  under  section  7(9)  are  the  Special  Immigration  Appeals Commission  (SIAC)  and  the  Proscribed  Organisations  Appeal  Commission (POAC) – not, contrary to the Court of Appeal’s understanding (see paras 20, 33 and 56 of the judgments below), the Employment Tribunal.   Page 3 \\x0c     I  have  already  set  out  section  65(2)(a)  of  RIPA.  Section  65(1)  made 5. provision for the establishment of the IPT and schedule 3 to the Act provides for its  membership.  Currently  its  President  is  Mummery  LJ  and  its  Vice-President, Burton J. Section 67(2) provides:   “Where  the  tribunal  hear  any  proceedings  by  virtue  of  section 65(2)(a),  they  shall  apply  the  same  principles  for  making  their determination in those proceedings as would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review.”    Section 67(7) empowers the Tribunal “to make any such award of compensation or other order as they think fit”. Section 67(8) provides:   “Except  to  such  extent  as  the  Secretary  of  State  may  by  order otherwise  provide,  determinations,  awards,  orders  and  other decisions  of  the  Tribunal  (including  decisions  as  to  whether  they have  jurisdiction)  shall  not  be  subject  to  appeal  or  be  liable  to  be questioned in any court.”    Section 68(1) provides:    Section 68(4) provides:   “Subject  to  any  rules  made  under  section  69,  the  Tribunal  shall  be entitled  to  determine  their  own  procedure  in  relation  to  any proceedings,  complaint  or  reference  brought  before  or  made  to them.” “Where  the  Tribunal  determine  any  proceedings,  complaint  or reference brought before or made to them, they shall give notice to the  complainant  which  (subject  to  any  rules  made  by  virtue  of section 69(2)(i)) shall be confined, as the case may be, to either -  (a)  a  statement  that  they  have  made  a  determination  in  his favour; or  (b)  a  statement  that  no  determination  has  been  made  in  his favour.”  Page 4 \\x0c     Section  69  confers  on  the  Secretary  of  State  the  rule-making  power 6. pursuant  to  which  were  made  the  Investigatory  Powers  Tribunal  Rules  2000  (SI No 2000/2665) (the Rules). Section 69(6) provides:   “In making rules under this section the Secretary of State shall have regard, in particular, to -   (a) the  need  to  secure  that  matters  which  are  the  subject  of proceedings, complaints or references brought before or made to the Tribunal are properly heard and considered; and (b) the  need  to  secure  that  information  is  not  disclosed  to  an extent,  or  in  a  manner,  that  is  contrary  to  the  public  interest  or prejudicial to national security, the prevention or detection of serious crime,  the  economic  well-being  of  the  United  Kingdom  or  the continued  discharge  of  the  functions  of  any  of  the  intelligence services.”   Rule 13(2) provides that where the Tribunal make a determination in favour 7. of  the  complainant  they  shall  provide  him  with  a  summary  of  that  determination including  any  findings  of  fact  (to  this  extent  qualifying  section  68(4)(a)  of  the Act). Rule 6(1) gives effect to section 69(6)(b) by providing that the Tribunal shall carry out their functions in such a way as to meet the stipulated need with regard to the non-disclosure of information. The effect of rules 6(2) and (3) is that, save with the consent of those concerned, the Tribunal may not disclose to the complainant or any other person any information or document disclosed or provided to them in the  course  of  any  hearing  or  the  identity  of  any  witness  at  that  hearing.  Rule  9 provides  that  the  Tribunal  are  under  no  duty  to  hold  oral  hearings  and  may  hold separate oral hearings for the complainant and the public authority against which the proceedings are brought.  Rule 9(6) provides that:   “The  Tribunal’s  proceedings,  including  any  oral  hearings,  shall  be conducted in private.”   8. In  Applications  Nos.  IPT/01/62  and  IPT/01/77  (23  January  2003)  the  IPT ruled on various preliminary issues of law regarding the legality of a number of the rules.  They  held  that  rule  9(6)  was  ultra  vires  section  69  of  RIPA  as  being incompatible  with  article  6  of  the  Convention  but  that  “in  all  other  respects  the Rules are valid and binding on the Tribunal and are compatible with articles 6, 8 and 10 of the Convention” (para 12 of the IPT’s 83 page ruling which is itself the subject  of  a  pending  application  before  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  Page 5 \\x0c     (ECtHR)). Consequent on their ruling on rule 9(b) the IPT published the transcript of the hearing in that case and now hear argument on points of law in open court.   9. A accepts that the legal challenge he is making to B’s decision is properly to  be  characterised  as  proceedings  under  section  7(1)(a)  of  HRA  within  the meaning of section 65(2)(a) of RIPA (and not, as he had argued before the judge at first instance, that he should be regarded merely as relying on his article 10 rights pursuant to section 7(1)(b) HRA), and that these are proceedings against one of the Intelligence  Services  within  the  meaning  of  section  65(3)(a)  (and  not,  as  he  had argued  before  the  Court  of  Appeal,  against  the  Crown).  He  nevertheless  submits that he is not required by section 65(2)(a) to proceed before the IPT. His first and main argument – the argument which prevailed before Collins J and was accepted also by Rix LJ – is that he is entitled to proceed either by way of judicial review or before the IPT, entirely at his own choice. Section 65(2)(a), he submits, excludes the section 7(1)(a) jurisdiction of any other tribunal but not that of the courts. His second and alternative argument (not advanced in either court below) is that, even if  section  65(2)(a)  is  to  be  construed  as  conferring  exclusive  section  7(1)(a) jurisdiction  on  the  IPT,  it  does  so  only  in  respect  of  proceedings  against  the intelligence services arising out of the exercise of one of the investigatory powers regulated by RIPA. This, of course, would  involve narrowing the apparent width of the expression “proceedings against any of the intelligence services” in section 65(3)(a) and, if correct, means that A here could not proceed before the IPT even if he wished to do so.   10. Justice have intervened in the appeal in support of A’s submissions. Like A, they urge us to adopt as narrow a construction of section 65 as possible, first, so as not  to  exclude  the  jurisdiction  of  the  ordinary  courts  and,  secondly,  to  avoid  a construction  which  they  submit  will  inevitably  give  rise  to  breaches  of  other Convention rights, most notably the article 6 right to a fair hearing.   Argument 1 – Section 65(2)(a) excludes only the jurisdiction of other tribunals   11. This argument focuses principally upon the use of the word “tribunal” in the expression “only appropriate tribunal” in section 65(2)(a). A says it that it means tribunals only and not courts; B says that it encompasses both. A says that if it was intended  to  exclude  courts  as  well  as  tribunals  it  would  have  used  the  same expression,  “the  appropriate  forum”,  as  was  used  in  section  65(2)(b),  65(4)  and 65(4A)  of  RIPA.  B  points  out  that  those  three  provisions  all  deal  with “complaints”,  for  which  provision  had  originally  been  made  in  the  Security Service  Act  1989  and  the  Intelligence  Services  Act  1994  and  which  are  not  the same  as  legal  claims,  “forum”  being,  therefore,  a  more  appropriate  term  to describe the venue for their resolution.  Page 6 \\x0c     Plainly  the  word  “tribunal”,  depending  on  the  context,  can  apply  either  to 12. tribunals in contradistinction to courts or to both tribunals and courts. As B points out, section 195(1) of the Extradition Act 2003 describes “the appropriate judge” (a  designated  District  Judge)  as  “the  only  appropriate  tribunal”  in  relation  to section 7(1)(a) HRA proceedings. So too section 11 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 describes “the court” (as thereafter defined) as “the appropriate tribunal for the purposes of section 7 of the Human Rights Act”.   13. Section  7(2)  of  HRA  itself  appears  to  require  that  a  court  or  tribunal  is designated  as  the  “appropriate  court  or  tribunal”,  not  that  both  are  designated. Couple  with  that  the  use  of  the  word  “only”  before  the  phrase  “appropriate tribunal” in section 65 and it seems to me distinctly unlikely that Parliament was intending to leave it to the complainant to choose for himself whether to bring his proceedings in court or before the IPT.    There  are,  moreover,  powerful  other  pointers  in  the  same  direction.  14. Principal  amongst  these  is  the  self-evident  need  to  safeguard  the  secrecy  and security of sensitive intelligence material, not least with regard to the working of the intelligence services. It is to this end, and to protect the “neither confirm nor deny” policy (equally obviously essential to the effective working of the services), that the Rules are as restrictive as they are regarding the closed nature of the IPT’s hearings and the limited disclosure of information to the complainant (both before and  after the  IPT’s  determination).  There  are,  however,  a  number  of counterbalancing provisions both in RIPA and the Rules to ensure that proceedings before  the  IPT  are  (in  the  words  of  section  69(6)(a))  “properly  heard  and considered”.  Section  68(6)  imposes  on  all  who  hold  office  under  the  Crown  and many others too the widest possible duties to provide information and documents to the IPT as they may require. Public interest immunity could never be invoked against  such  a  requirement.  So  too  sections  57(3)  and  59(3)  impose  respectively upon  the  Interception  of  Communications  Commissioner  and  the  Intelligence Services  Commissioner  duties  to  give  the  IPT  “all  such  assistance”  as  it  may require.  Section  18(1)(c)  disapplies  the  otherwise  highly  restrictive  effect  of section 17 (regarding the existence and use of intercept material) in the case of IPT proceedings. And rule 11(1) allows the IPT to “receive evidence in any form, and [to]  receive  evidence  that  would  not  be  admissible  in  a  court  of  law.”  All  these provisions  in  their  various  ways  are  designed  to  ensure  that,  even  in  the  most sensitive of intelligence cases, disputes can be properly determined. None of them are available in the courts. This was the point that so strongly attracted Dyson LJ in favour of B’s case in the court below. As he pithily put it at [2009] 3 WLR 717, para 48:   “It seems to me to be inherently unlikely that Parliament intended to create  an  elaborate  set  of  rules  to  govern  proceedings  against  an  Page 7 \\x0c     intelligence  service  under  section  7 of  the  1998  Act  in  the  IPT  and yet contemplated that such proceedings might be brought before the courts without any rules.”   15.  A further telling consideration against the contention that section 65(2)(a) is intended  only  to  exclude  other  tribunals  with  jurisdiction  to  consider  section 7(1)(a)  HRA  claims  is  that  there  are  in  fact  none  such  with  section  7(1)(a) jurisdiction over the categories of claim listed in section 65(3). As stated (at para 4 above),  only  SIAC  and  POAC  have  section  7(1)(a)  jurisdiction  and  in  each instance that is with regard to matters outside the scope of section 65. The Court of Appeal  were  under  the  misapprehension  that  the  Employment  Tribunal  too  had section 7(1)(a) jurisdiction and were accordingly mistaken in supposing, as Rix LJ put it at para 33, that “[t]herefore, section 65(2)(a) of the 2000 Act has content as referring to the IPT as ‘the only appropriate tribunal’”.   In  the  light  of  these  various  considerations  it  is  hardly  surprising  that  A 16. himself  recognises  that  this  construction  produces  “a  slightly  unsatisfactory legislative  outcome”,  although  he  submits  that  “this  is  a  small  price  to  pay  for protecting the article 6 rights of claimants and respecting the principle that access to the courts should not be denied save by clear words”, a submission to which I shall come after considering A’s alternative contended-for construction.   Argument 2 – Section 65(2)(a) confers exclusive jurisdiction on the IPT but only in respect  of  proceedings  arising  out  of  the  exercise  of  one  of  the  RIPA  regulated investigatory powers   17.  Although this was not an argument advanced at any stage below, I confess to having been attracted to it for a while. After all, in enacting RIPA, Parliament must have had principally in mind the use and abuse of the particular investigatory powers regulated by the Act and there would not appear to be the same need for secrecy, the withholding of information and the “neither confirm nor deny” policy in  the  case  of  an  ex-officer  as  in  the  case  of  someone  outside  the  intelligence community.   18. The difficulties of such a construction, however, are obvious and in the end, to  my  mind,  insurmountable.  As  already  observed,  it  would  involve  reading  into section 65(3)(a) limiting words which are simply not there. This would be difficult enough at the best of times. Given, however, that other paragraphs of section 65(3) are  in  fact  more  obviously  directed  to  complaints  of  abuse  of  the  intelligence services’  regulatory  powers  (see  particularly  section  65(3)(d)  read  with  sections  Page 8 \\x0c     65(5)(a) and 65(7), none of which I have thought it necessary to set out), it seems to me quite impossible to construe the section as this argument invites us to do.   19.  Nor,  indeed,  on  reflection,  does  it  seem right to regard proceedings of the kind intended here as immune from much the same requirement for non-disclosure of information as other proceedings against the intelligence services. As B points out,  it  is  perfectly  possible  that  the  security  service  will  ask  the  tribunal  hearing this  dispute  to  consider  additional  material  of  which  A  may  be  unaware  (and  of which  the  security  service  is  properly  concerned  that  he  should  remain  unaware) which leads it to believe that the publication of A’s manuscript would be harmful to  national  security.  On  any  view,  moreover,  the  proceedings  by  which  any tribunal  comes  to  determine  whether  the  disputed  parts  of  the  manuscript  can safely  be  published  would  have  to  be  heard  in  secret.  Again,  therefore,  the existence of the IPT Rules designed to provide for just such proceedings and the lack  of  any  equivalent  rules  available  to  the  courts  points  strongly  against  this alternative construction also.   20.  Are  there,  however,  sufficiently  strong  arguments  available  to  A  (and Justice) to compel the court, with or without resort to section 3 of HRA, to adopt a contrary construction of section 65?  It is convenient to consider these arguments under three broad heads.   i.   21.  A  and  Justice  argue  that  to  construe  section  65  as  conferring  exclusive jurisdiction  on  the  IPT  constitutes  an  ouster  of  the  ordinary  jurisdiction  of  the courts  and  is  constitutionally objectionable  on  that  ground.  They  pray  in  aid  two decisions of high authority: Pyx Granite Co Ltd v Ministry of Housing and Local Government  [1960]  AC  260  and  Anisminic  Ltd  v  Foreign  Compensation Commission  [1969]  2  AC  147.  To  my  mind,  however,  the  argument  is unsustainable.  In  the  first  place,  it  is  evident,  as  the  majority  of  the  Court  of Appeal  pointed  out,  that  the  relevant  provisions  of  RIPA,  HRA  and  the  CPR  all came into force at the same time as part of a single legislative scheme. With effect from  2  October  2000  section 7(1)(a)  HRA  jurisdiction  came  into  existence  (i)  in respect  of  section  65(3)  proceedings  in  the  IPT  pursuant  to  section  65(2)(a),  and (ii) in respect of any other section 7(1)(a) HRA proceedings in the courts pursuant to section 7(9) and CPR 7.11. True it is, as Rix LJ observed, that CPR 7.11(2) does not explicitly recognise the exception to its apparent width represented by section 65(2)(a). But that is not to say that section 65(2)(a) ousts some pre-existing right.     Ouster  Page 9 \\x0c     This  case,  in  short,  falls  within  the  principle  recognised  by  the  House  of 22. Lords in Barraclough v Brown [1897] AC 615 – where, as Lord Watson said at p 622:  “The  right  and  the  remedy  are  given  uno  flatu,  and  the  one  cannot  be dissociated  from  the  other.”  -  rather  than  the  principle  for  which  Pyx  Granite stands (p 286):   “It  is  a  principle  not  by  any  means  to  be  whittled  down  that  the subject’s  recourse  to  Her  Majesty’s  courts  for  the  determination  of his rights is not to be excluded except by clear words.”   Distinguishing  Barraclough  v  Brown,  Viscount  Simonds  pointed  out  that  the statute  there  in  question  could  be  construed  as  merely  providing  an  alternative means of determining whether or not the company had a pre-existing common law right to develop their land; it did not take away “the inalienable remedy . . . to seek redress  in  [the  courts]”.  Before  2  October  2000  there  was,  of  course,  no  pre-existing  common  law  or  statutory  right  to  bring  a  claim  based  on  an  asserted breach of the Convention.  Section 65(2)(a) takes away no “inalienable remedy”.   23.  Nor  does  Anisminic  assist  A.  The  ouster  clause  there  under  consideration purported  to  remove  any  judicial  supervision  of  a  determination  by  an  inferior tribunal as to its own jurisdiction. Section 65(2)(a) does no such thing. Parliament has  not  ousted  judicial  scrutiny  of  the  acts  of  the  intelligence  services;  it  has simply allocated that scrutiny (as to section 7(1)(a) HRA proceedings) to the IPT. Furthermore, as Laws LJ observed at para 22:    “[S]tatutory  measures  which  confide  the  jurisdiction  to  a  judicial body  of  like  standing  and  authority  to  that  of  the  High  Court,  but which  operates  subject  to  special  procedures  apt  for  the  subject matter in hand, may well be constitutionally inoffensive. The IPT . . . offers . . . no cause for concern on this score.”   True it is that section 67(8) of RIPA constitutes an ouster (and, indeed, unlike that in  Anisminic,  an  unambiguous  ouster)  of  any  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  over  the IPT.  But  that  is  not  the  provision  in  question  here  and  in  any  event,  as  A recognises,  there  is  no  constitutional  (or  article  6)  requirement  for  any  right  of appeal from an appropriate tribunal.     The  position  here  is  analogous  to  that  in  Farley  v  Secretary  of  State  for 24. Work and Pensions (No. 2) [2006] 1 WLR 1817 where the statutory provision in  Page 10 \\x0c     question  provided  that,  on  an  application  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  a  liability order  in  respect  of  a  person  liable  to  pay  child  support,  “the  court  .  .  .  shall  not question  the  maintenance  assesment  under  which  the  payments  of  child  support maintenance fall to be made.” Lord Nicholls, with whom the other members of the Committee agreed, observed, at para 18:   “The  need  for  a  strict  approach  to  the  interpretation  of  an  ouster provision  .  .  .  was  famously  confirmed  in  the  leading  case  of Anisminic . . . This strict approach, however, is not appropriate if an effective  means  of  challenging  the  validity  of  a  maintenance assessment  is  provided  elsewhere.  Then  section  33(4)  is  not  an ouster  provision.    Rather,  it  is  part  of  a  statutory  scheme  which allocates jurisdiction to determine the validity of an assessment and decide whether the defendant is a ‘liable person’ to a court other than the magistrates’ court.”   ii.  Convention rights   25.  A  and  Justice  submit  that  to  force  this  article  10  challenge  into  the  IPT would inevitably result in breaches of article 6. In support of this submission they rely principally upon the following features of the IPT’s procedures: first, that the entire hearing (save for purely legal argument) will be not only private but secret, indeed claimants may not even be told whether a hearing has been or will be held; secondly, that the submissions and evidence relied on respectively by the claimant and the respondent may be considered at separate hearings; thirdly, that only with the  respondent’s  consent  will  the  claimant  be  informed  of  the  opposing  case  or given access to any of the respondent’s evidence; fourthly, that no reasons will be given  for  any  adverse  determination.  All  of  this,  runs  the  argument,  is  flatly contrary  to  the  basic  principles  of  open  justice:  that  there  should  be  a  public hearing at which the parties have a proper opportunity to challenge the opposing case and after which they will learn the reasons for an adverse determination.   26.  As, however, already explained (at para 14), claims against the intelligence services  inevitably  raise  special  problems and simply cannot be  dealt  with  in  the same  way  as  other  claims.  This,  indeed,  has  long  since  been  recognised  both domestically and in Strasbourg. It is sufficient for present purposes to cite a single paragraph from the speech of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in R v Shayler [2003] 1 AC 247, para 26 (another case raising article 10 considerations):    Page 11 \\x0c     “The  need  to  preserve  the  secrecy  of  information  relating  to intelligence  and  military  operations  in  order  to  counter  terrorism, criminal activity, hostile activity and subversion has been recognised by the European Commission and the Court in relation to complaints made  under  article  10  and  other  articles  under  the  Convention:  see Engel v The Netherlands (No 1) (1976) 1 EHRR 647, paras 100-103; Klass v Federal Republic of Germany (1978) 2 EHRR 214, para 48; Leander v Sweden (1987) 9 EHRR 433, para 59; Hadjianastassiou v Greece  (1992)  16  EHRR  219,  paras  45-47;  Esbester  v  United Kingdom  (1993)  18  EHRR  CD  72,  74;  Brind  v  United  Kingdom (1994)  18  EHRR  CD  76,  83-84;  Murray  v  United  Kingdom  (1994) 19  EHRR  193,  para  58;  Vereniging  Weekblad  Bluf!  v  The Netherlands (1995) 20 EHRR 189, paras 35, 40. The thrust of these decisions  and  judgments  has  not  been  to  discount  or  disparage  the need  for  strict  and  enforceable  rules  but  to  insist  on  adequate safeguards  to  ensure  that  the  restriction  does  not  exceed  what  is necessary to achieve the end in question.  The acid test is whether, in individual’s all Convention  right  prescribed  by  national  law  is  greater  than  is required  to  meet  the  legitimate  object  which  the  state  seeks  to achieve.  The  OSA  1989,  as  it  applies  to  the  appellant,  must  be considered in that context.” the  circumstances, interference  with the the   27. In one of the Strasbourg cases there referred to, Esbester v United Kingdom, and  indeed  in  a  series  of  other  cases  brought  against  the  UK  at  about  the  same time,  the  Strasbourg  Commission  rejected  complaints  as  to  the  form  of proceedings  adopted  by  the  Security  Service  Tribunal  and  the  Interception  of Communications Tribunal, not least as to the absence of a reasoned determination.   28. I  acknowledge  that  later  in  his  opinion  in  Shayler  (at  para  31)  Lord Bingham, contemplating the possibility that authority to publish might have been refused  without  adequate  justification  (or  at  any  rate  where  the  former  member firmly believed that no adequate justification existed), said:   “In  this  situation  the  former  member  is  entitled  to  seek  judicial review of the decision to refuse, a course which the OSA 1989 does not seek to inhibit.”   In  that  case,  however,  the  disclosures  had  been  made  before  the  enactment  of RIPA  and  the  creation  of  the  IPT  and  it  is  plain  that  the  House  had  not  been referred  to  section  65(2)(a),  still  less  had  had  occasion  to  consider  its  scope.  It cannot sensibly be supposed that the case would have been decided any differently  Page 12 \\x0c     had it been recognised that after 2 October 2000 such a challenge would have had to be brought before the IPT.   29.  Admittedly the Esbester line of cases were decided in the context of article 8  (rather  than  article  10)  and,  understandably,  Strasbourg  attaches  particular weight to the right to freedom of expression. Neither A nor Justice, however, were able  to  show  us  any  successful  article  10  cases  involving  national  security considerations  save  only  for  Sunday  Times  v  UK  (No.  2)  (1991)  14  EHRR  229 (Spycatcher)  where,  of  course,  the  disputed  material  was  already  in  the  public domain.   For my part I am wholly unpersuaded that the hearing of A’s complaint in 30. the  IPT  will  necessarily  involve  a  breach  of  article  6.  There  is  some  measure  of flexibility in the IPT’s rules such as allows it to adapt its procedures to provide as much  information  to  the  complainant  as  possible  consistently  with  national security interests. In any event, of course, through his lengthy exchanges with B, A has  learned  in  some  detail  why  objections  to  publication  remain.  Article  6 complaints fall to be judged in the light of all the circumstances of the case. We would, it seems to me, be going further than the Strasbourg jurisprudence has yet gone  were  we  to  hold  in  the  abstract  that  the  IPT  procedures  are  necessarily incompatible  with  article  6(1).  Consistently  with  the  well  known  rulings  of  the House of Lords in R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator [2004] 2 AC 323 para 20 and R (Al-Skeini)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  Defence  [2008]  1  AC  153  paras  105,  106,  I would  decline  to  do  so,  particularly  since,  as  already  mentioned,  the  IPT’s  own decision on its rules is shortly to be considered by the ECtHR.   31.  Over  and  above  all  this  is  the  further  and  fundamental  consideration,  that even if the IPT’s Rules and procedures are in any way incompatible with article 6, the remedy for that lies rather in their modification than in some artificially limited construction of the IPT’s jurisdiction. It is, indeed, difficult to understand which of the  appellant’s  contended-for  constructions  is  said  to  be  advanced  by  this submission. On any view the IPT has some jurisdiction. Yet the argument involves a root and branch challenge to its procedures in all cases.   iii.   32. The Court of Appeal’s construction of section 65(2)(a) is said to give rise to a number of anomalies. Under this head I shall touch too upon certain other points advanced variously by A and Justice.  Anomalies  Page 13 \\x0c     The first anomaly is said to be that while section 7(1)(a) HRA proceedings 33. have to be brought before the IPT, other causes of action or public law grounds for judicial  review  need  not.  This  point  troubled  Rix  LJ  who  asked  ([2009]  3WLR 717, para 39): “what is so special about section 7 proceedings under the 1998 Act against the intelligence services . . .?” The answer surely is that such claims are the most  likely  to  require  a  penetrating  examination  of  the  justification  for  the intelligence  services’  actions  and,  therefore,  close  scrutiny  of  sensitive  material and  operational  judgment.  But  it  may  well  be  (as,  indeed,  Rix  LJ  foresaw)  that section 65(2)(d) of RIPA will be brought into force so that the Secretary of State can  allocate  other  proceedings  too  exclusively  to  the  IPT.  Meantime,  subject always to the court’s abuse of process jurisdiction and the exercise of its discretion in public law cases, proceedings outside section 7(1)(a) can still be brought in the courts so that full effect is given to the preservation of such rights by section 11 of HRA.   34. It  is  similarly  said  to  be  anomalous  that  whereas  A,  responsibly  seeking prior  clearance  for  the  publication  of  his  manuscript,  is  driven  into  the  IPT, someone in a similar position, although perhaps facing injunctive proceedings for having sought to publish without permission, would be entitled pursuant to section 7(1)(b) HRA to rely in those ordinary court proceedings on their article 10 rights. Whilst I readily see the force of this, the answer to it may be that defences were not sufficiently thought through at the time of this legislation and that more, rather than  fewer,  proceedings  involving  the  intelligence  services  should  be  allocated exclusively to the IPT.   35.  A  further  anomaly  is  said  to  be  that  Special  Branch  police  officers  and Ministry  of  Defence  special  forces  may  well  carry  out  work  of  comparable sensitivity  to  that  undertaken  by  the  intelligence  services  and  yet  section  7(1)(a) HRA claims brought against them would proceed in the ordinary courts and not in the IPT. Part of the answer to this is to be found in “the special position of those employed  in  the  security  and  intelligence  services,  and  the  special  nature  of  the work they carry out” (Lord Bingham’s opinion in Shayler at para 36); the rest in the same response as to the earlier points: perhaps the IPT’s exclusive jurisdiction should be widened.   36. Sitting  a  little  uneasily  alongside  the  last  suggested  anomaly  is  the contention that section 65(2)(a) vests in the IPT exclusive jurisdiction over various kinds  of  proceedings  against  people  quite  other  than  the  intelligence  services which may involve little if anything in the way of sensitive material – for example, pursuant to section 65(3)(c), proceedings under section 55(4) of RIPA with regard to  accessing  encrypted  data.  Whatever  view  one  takes  about  this,  however,  it  is impossible to see how it supports either of the alternative constructions of section 65 for which A contends.  Page 14 \\x0c     In  short,  none  of  the  suggested  anomalies  resulting  from  the  Court  of 37. Appeal’s  construction  seems  to  me  to  cast  the  least  doubt  on  its  correctness  let alone to compel some strained alternative construction of the section.   38. I see no reason to doubt that the IPT is well able to give full consideration to  this  dispute  about  the  publication  of  A’s  manuscript  and,  adjusting  the procedures as necessary, to resolve it justly. Quite why A appears more concerned than B about the lack of any subsequent right of appeal is difficult to understand. Either  way,  Parliament  has  dictated  that  the  IPT  has  exclusive  and  final jurisdiction in the matter. I would dismiss the appeal.      LORD HOPE   39. I agree with Lord Brown’s opinion. I wish only to add a few brief footnotes. The Rules   40.  As Lord Brown has explained (see para 14, above), among the factors that reinforce  the  conclusion  that  is  to  be  drawn  from  the  terms  of  the  statute  that Parliament  did  not  intend  to  leave  it  to  the  complainant  to  choose  for  himself whether  to  bring  his  proceedings  in  a  court  or  before  the  IPT  are  the  provisions that  RIPA  contains  about  the  rules  that  may  be  made  under  it.  In  Hanlon  v  The Law  Society  [1981]  AC  124,  193-194  Lord  Lowry  set  out  the  circumstances  in which a regulation made under a statutory power was admissible for the purpose of construing the statute under which it was made. The use of the rules themselves as an  aid  to  construction,  in  addition  to  what  RIPA  itself  says  about  them,  needs however to be treated with some care.     41. In Deposit Protection Board v Dalia [1994] 2 AC 367 the issue was as to the meaning of the word “depositor”, and the regulations that were prayed in aid were  made  four  years  after  the  date  of  the  enactment.  At  p  397  Lord  Browne-Wilkinson said that regulations could only be used an aid to construction where the regulations are roughly contemporaneous with the Act being construed. In Dimond v Lovell [2000] QB 216, para 48 Sir Richard Scott VC said that he did not think that the content of regulations which postdated the Consumer Credit Act 1974 by some nine years could be taken to be a guide to what Parliament intended by the language  used  in  the  Act.  One  must  also  bear  in  mind,  as  Lord  Lowry  said  in Hanlon at p 193-194, that regulations cannot be said to control the meaning of the Act, as that would be to disregard the role of the court as interpreter.       Page 15 \\x0c     42. In  this  case  the  statute  received  the  Royal  Assent  on  28  July  2000.  The Investigatory  Powers  Tribunal  Rules  2000  (SI  2000/2665)  were  made  on  28 September 2000 and laid before Parliament the next day. The interval was so short that, taken together, they can be regarded as all part of same legislative exercise. But, as Mr Crow QC for B submitted, it is not the content of the rules as such that matters here. Rather it is the fact that the Act itself put a specialist regime in place to  ensure  that  the  IPT  was  properly  equipped  to  deal  with  sensitive  intelligence material. Section 68(4) of RIPA limits the information that the Tribunal may give to  a  complainant  where  they  determine  any  complaint  brought  before  them  to  a statement  that  a  determination  either  has  been  or  has  not  been  made  in  the complainant’s  favour.  Section  69(4)  states  that  the  Secretary  of  State’s  power  to make  rules  under  that  section  includes  power  to  make  rules  that  limit  the information that is given to the complainant and the extent of his participation in the proceedings. Section 69(6)(b) states that in making rules under that section the Secretary  of  State  shall  have  regard  in  particular  to  the  need  to  secure  that information  is  not  disclosed  to  an  extent  that  is  contrary  to  the  public  interest  or prejudicial to national security.     43. The  fact  that  this  regime  was  so  carefully  designed  to  protect  the  public interest by the scheme that is set out in the statute is in itself a strong pointer to the conclusion that Parliament did not intend by section 65(2)(a) that the jurisdiction of the IPT in relation to claims of the kind that A seeks to bring in this case was to be optional. I do not think that it is necessary to go further and look at the Rules themselves, as the indication that the statute itself gives is so clear on this point.   Anomalies   44.  Although  he  adopted  a  different  stance  before  Collins  J,  as  the  judge recorded  in  para  20  of  his  opinion [2008]  EWHC  1512  (Admin),  A  now  accepts that  the  legal  challenge  that  he  is  making  to  B’s  decision  is  properly  to  be characterised as proceedings under section 7(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998 and not under section 7(1)(b) of that Act. Section 7(1)(a) of the 1998 Act provides that a person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes to act) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) may “bring proceedings against the authority  under  this  Act  in  the  appropriate  court  of  tribunal”.  Section  7(1)(b) provides,  in  the  alternative,  that  he  may  “rely  on  the  Convention  right  or  rights concerned in any legal proceedings”.     45.  As  Clayton  &  Tomlinson,  The  Law  of  Human  Rights,  2nd  ed  (2009),  para 22.03, puts it:   Page 16 \\x0c     “This section contemplates two ways in which a person may advance a  contention  that  a  public  authority  has  acted  in  a  way  which  is incompatible  with  his  Convention  rights:  either  by  making  a  free standing  claim  based  on  a  Convention  right  in  accordance  with section 7(1)(a) or by relying on a Convention right in proceedings in accordance with section 7(1)(b).”   In  R  v  Kansal  (No  2)  [2002]  2  AC  69,  105-106  I  said  that  section  7(1)(a)  and section  7(1)(b)  are  designed  to  provide  two  quite  different  remedies.  Section 7(1)(a) enables the victim of the unlawful act to bring proceedings under the Act against the authority. It is intended to cater for free-standing claims made under the Act where there are no other proceedings in which the claim can be made. It does not  apply  where  the  victim  wishes  to  rely  on  his  Convention  rights  in  existing proceedings  which  have  been  brought  against  him  by  a  public  authority.  His remedy  in  those  proceedings  is  that  provided  by  section  7(1)(b),  which  is  not subject to the time limit on proceedings under section 7(1)(a) prescribed by section 7(5); see also Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No 2) [2004] 1 AC 816, para 90. The  purpose  of  section  7(1)(b)  is  to  enable  persons  against  whom  proceedings have been brought by a public authority to rely on the Convention rights for their protection.    46. The fact that section 65(2)(a) requires proceedings under section 7(1)(a) to be brought before the IPT, while relying on section 7(1)(b) was not subject to this requirement, was said by Mr Millar QC to be anomalous. Why, he said, should a claim  be  so  restricted  when  a  defence  relying  on  Convention  rights  to  injunctive proceedings  by  a  public  authority,  or  a  counterclaim,  was  not?  I  am  reluctant  to conclude  that  the  omission  of  a  reference  to  section  7(1)(b)  was  due  to  an oversight,  and  I  do  not  think  that  when  regard  is  had  to  the  purpose  of  these provisions there is any anomaly.     47. I would reject the suggestion that a counterclaim against a public authority on the ground that it has acted (or proposes to act) in a way that is made unlawful under section 6(1) of the 1998 Act should be regarded as having been made under section 7(1)(b). This issue is not to be resolved by reference to the procedural route by  which  the  claim  is  made  but  by  reference  to  the  substance  of  the  claim.  A counterclaim against a public authority for a breach of Convention rights is to be treated as a claim for the purposes of section 7(1)(a): see section 7(2) which states include  a  counterclaim  or  similar that  proceedings  against  an  authority proceedings. It will be subject to the time limit on proceedings under that provision in section 7(5).      Page 17 \\x0c      48.  As  for  defences,  the  scheme  of  the  1998  Act  is  that  a  person  who  is  (or would be) a victim of an act that it is made unlawful by section 6(1) because the public authority has acted (or proposes to act) in that way is entitled to raise that issue  as  a  defence  in  any  legal  proceedings  that  may  be  brought  against  him. Section 7(1)(b) contemplates proceedings in which it would be open to the court or tribunal to grant relief against the public authority on grounds relating to a breach of the person’s Convention rights, such as those guaranteed by article 6. The scope for inquiry is relatively limited in comparison with that which may be opened up by a claim made under section 7(1)(a).     49. It  is  possible,  however,  to  envisage  a  situation  in  which  a  defence  to  an application  for  injunctive  relief  by  the  intelligence  services  would  open  up  for inquiry issues of the kind that section 65(2)(a) of RIPA reserves for determination by  the  IPT  if  they  were  to  be  subject  of  a  claim  under  section  7(1)(a),  the disclosure  of  which  would  be  contrary  to  the  public  interest  or  prejudicial  to national  security.  It  is  true  that  the  legislation  does  not  address  this  problem, perhaps because it was thought inappropriate to reserve to the IPT proceedings that were initiated by and in the control of the intelligence services or any other person in respect of conduct on their behalf. But the situation that this reveals is, I think, properly to be regarded as a product of the way the legislative scheme itself was framed. It does not provide a sound reason for thinking that Parliament intended to leave it to the complainant to choose whether to bring his proceedings in a court rather than before the IPT.   50. Like Lord Brown, I can find nothing in this alleged anomaly, or in any of the  others  that  have  been  suggested,  that  supports  the  construction  of  section 65(2)(a) for which A contends.                                          Page 18'}, 'press summary': {'Press summary': 'R (on the application of A) (Appellant) v B (Respondent) [2009] UKSC 12 On appeal from the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) [2008] EWCA Civ 24', 'Justices': 'Lord Phillips (President), Lord Hope (Deputy President), Lord Brown, Lord Mance, Lord Clarke', 'Background to the appeal': 'A is a former member of the Security Service, B its Director of Establishments.  A wants to publish a book about his work in the Security Service.  A duty of confidentiality binds A and he cannot publish material relating to the Security Service without B’s consent.  B refused A’s application for consent to publish.  As a result, A began proceedings in the High Court to challenge B’s decision.  He claimed, amongst  other  things,  that  his  right  to  freedom  of  expression  under  article  10  of  the  European Convention on Human Rights had been breached.  B argued that section 65(2)(a) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (“RIPA”) provided that the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (“the IPT”) was  “the  only  appropriate  tribunal”  in  relation  to  proceedings  under  section  7(1)(a)  of  the  Human Rights  Act  1998  brought  against  the  intelligence  services,  such  that  the  High  Court  did  not  have jurisdiction to entertain A’s article 10 claim.   The High Court held that it had jurisdiction to hear A’s challenge.  The Court of Appeal, by a majority, reversed the High Court’s decision, holding that exclusive jurisdiction did lie with the IPT.  A appealed to the Supreme Court.  Justice (an all-party law reform and human rights organisation) intervened in the appeal in support of A’s submissions.', 'Judgment': 'The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed A’s appeal.  Lord Brown, with whom all the members of the Court agreed, gave the leading judgment.  Lord Hope gave a concurring opinion.', 'Reasons for the judgment': 'Two alternative arguments were advanced by A:  \\uf0b7  Section 65(2)(a) excludes the section 7(1)(a) jurisdiction of any other tribunal but not that of the courts.   \\uf0b7  Even if section 65(2)(a) is to be construed as conferring exclusive section 7(1)(a) jurisdiction on the IPT, it does so only in respect of proceedings against the intelligence services arising out of the exercise of one of the investigatory powers regulated by RIPA. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.gov.uk   \\x0cAs to the first argument, Lord Brown noted that the language of section 7(2) of the 1998 Act and the use of the word “only” before “appropriate tribunal” in section 65(2)(a) indicated that it was unlikely that  Parliament  was  intending  to  leave  it  to  a  complainant  to  choose  for  himself  whether  to  bring proceedings  in  court  or  before  the  IPT  (Para  13).    Whilst  the  IPT  rules  made  under  RIPA  were restrictive  (e.g.  in  relation  to  the  limited  disclosure  of  information  to  a  complainant),  there  were various provisions in RIPA and the IPT rules which were designed to ensure that, even in the most sensitive cases, disputes could be properly determined.  None of these provisions would be available in the courts (Para 14).  A further telling consideration against A’s construction was that there were in fact  no  other  tribunals  with  section  7(1)(a)  jurisdiction  over  the  categories  of  claim  listed  in  section 65(3) of RIPA (Para 15).    As to the second argument, Lord Brown considered that A’s submission would involve reading into section  65(3)(a)  (which  contains  the  phrase  “proceedings  against  any  of  the  intelligence  services”) words  which  were  simply  not  there.    There  were,  in  addition,  other  provisions  in  RIPA  which  were more  obviously  directed  to  complaints  of  abuse  of  the  intelligence  services’  regulatory  power  which made  it  impossible  to  adopt  A’s  construction  (Para  18).    It  also  did  not  seem  right  to  regard proceedings  of  the  kind  intended  here  as  immune  from  the  same  requirement  for  non-disclosure  of information as other proceedings against the intelligence services (Para 19).  Lord Brown then went on to consider whether there were sufficiently strong arguments available to A which would require the Court to construe section 65 in a way which was contrary to Lord Brown’s initial conclusions as to its construction.  For the reasons set out below, Lord Brown concluded that there were no such arguments available to A.    Lord  Brown  rejected  A’s  argument  to  the  effect  that  to  construe  section  65  as  conferring  exclusive jurisdiction  on  the  IPT  would  constitute  an  ouster  of  the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  that  would  be constitutionally objectionable (Para 21).  RIPA, the 1998 Act and the Civil Procedure Rules all came into force at the same time as part of a single legislative scheme and it could not be said that section 65(2)(a) was ousting some pre-existing right (Paras 21-22).  Parliament had not ousted judicial scrutiny of  the  acts  of  the  intelligence  services,  but  had  simply  allocated  that  scrutiny  (as  to  section  7(1)(a) proceedings) to the IPT (Para 23-24).  Lord Brown also rejected the argument that forcing A’s article 10 challenge into the IPT would result in breaches of article 6 of the Convention.  Claims against intelligence services inevitably raise special problems  that  cannot  be  dealt  with  in  the  same  way  as  other  claims  and  this  was  recognised  both domestically  and  by  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  (Para  26).    The  Court  would  be  going further  than  the  Strasbourg  jurisprudence  if  it  were  to  hold  that  the  IPT  procedures  are  necessarily incompatible with article 6(1) and it would decline to do so here (Para 30).  Even if the IPT’s rules are in any way incompatible with article 6, the remedy would be to modify them, instead of adopting some artificially limited construction of the IPT’s jurisdiction (Para 31).      The anomalies which A alleged would arise if the Court of Appeal’s construction were to be adopted also did not cast doubt on the correctness of the Court of Appeal’s decision (Paras 32-37).

The members of the Court are well aware of the limited nature of the issue which we have to decide in this appeal. But many of the general public (who are understandably taking  a  close  interest  in  the  matter)  are  not  so  well  aware  of  its  limited  scope.  It  is therefore  appropriate  to  spell  out  at  the  outset  that  the  Court  does  not  have  the  task  of deciding whether the system of charging personal current account customers adopted by United Kingdom banks is fair. The appellants are seven of the largest banks in the United Kingdom and one building society (but I shall for convenience refer to them all as “the banks”). The appellants accept that the system of “free if in credit” banking prevalent in this country involves a significant cross-subsidy (amounting to about 30 per cent of the banks’ total revenue stream from current account customers) provided by those customers who  regularly  incur  charges  for  unauthorised  overdrafts  (a  cohort,  we  were  told,  of  the order of twelve million people) to those customers (a cohort of about 42 million people) who are in the fortunate position of never (or very rarely) incurring such charges. Banks in  other  European  countries  adopt  different  forms  of  cross-subsidy;  French  banks  for instance,  concentrate  their  charges  on  processing  standing  orders  and  debit  card transactions. 2. Some would regard the United Kingdom system as being, in some sense at least, obviously  unfair,  though  Mr  Sumption  QC  (for  the  banks)  vigorously  disputed  Lord Mance’s  suggestion  that  his  clients  were  engaged  in  a  sort  of  “reverse  Robin  Hood exercise”.  That  is  an  imponderable  question  which  depends  partly  on  whether  one’s perception of the average customer who incurs unauthorised overdraft charges is that he is spendthrift  and  improvident,  or  that she is disadvantaged and finding it hard to make ends meet.  But it is not the question for the Court.  3. The question for the Court is much more limited, and more technical. It is whether as  a  matter  of  law  the  fairness  of  bank  charges  levied  on  personal  current  account customers in respect of unauthorised overdrafts (including unpaid item charges and other related  charges  as  described  below)  can  be  challenged  by  the  respondent  the  Office  of Fair  Trading  (the  “OFT”)  as  excessive  in  relation  to  the  services  supplied  to  the customers.  4. That  issue  depends  on  the  correct  interpretation  (in  its  European  context)  and application  of  Regulation  6(2)  of  the  Unfair  Terms  in  Consumer  Contracts  Regulations 1999 SI 1999/2083 (“the 1999 Regulations”). Regulation 6(2) is as follows:  Page 2 \\x0c            “In  so  far  as  it  is  in  plain  intelligible  language,  the assessment of fairness of a term shall not relate –  (a)  to  the  definition  of  the  main  subject  matter  of  the contract, or (b) to the adequacy of the price or remuneration, as against the goods or services supplied in exchange.” The  context  requires  “adequacy”  to  be  read  in  the  sense  of  “appropriateness,”  as  Lord Rodger  of  Earlsferry  pointed  out  in  Director  General  of  Fair  Trading  v  First  National Bank plc [2001] UKHL 52, [2002] 1 AC 481, para 64. The Directive and the Regulations 5. The  1999  Regulations  were  made  under  section  2(2)  of  the  European Communities  Act  1972  in  order  to  transpose  into  national  law  Council  Directive 93/13/EEC  on  unfair  terms  in  consumer  contracts  (“the  Directive”).  The  1999 Regulations  revoked  and  replaced  similar  regulations  made  in  1994  (SI  1994/3159)  in order (as the explanatory note to the 1999 Regulations puts it) “to reflect more closely the wording  of  the  Directive”.  Regulation  6(2)  of  the  1999  Regulations  does  indeed  follow closely the English text of Article 4(2) of the Directive, which is as follows: “Assessment  of  the  unfair  nature  of  the  terms  shall  relate neither  to  the  definition  of  the  main  subject  matter  of  the contract nor to the adequacy of the price and remuneration, on the one hand, as against the services or goods supplied in exchange, on the other, in so far as these terms are in plain intelligible language.” The Court has had available the texts of Article 4(2) in French, German and some other languages, but they cast little light on the interpretation of the English text.  6. Both  Mr  Sumption  (for  the  banks)  and  Mr  Crow  QC  (for  the  OFT)  made submissions  about  the  background  to  the  Directive,  its  travaux  préparatoires,  and academic commentaries on it. The Directive in its final form applies only to contractual terms which have not been individually negotiated. That is the effect of Article 3, which sets  a  fairly  high  threshold  for  meeting  that  test.  The  Council’s  original  proposals  had  Page 3 \\x0c        been more far-reaching but they attracted a lot of criticism, especially from commentators in France and Germany, who were concerned at such extensive inroads into freedom of contract.  An  article  by  Professor  Brandner  and  Professor  Ulmer  of  the  University  of Heidelberg ((1991) 28 CML Rev 647) was particularly influential. In September 1992 the Council brought forward new proposals which can be described as a compromise solution balancing the need for consumer protection against residual freedom of contract. Recital (19)  reflects  part  of  this  compromise,  though  it  does  not  contribute  very  much  to  the understanding of Article 4(2): “Whereas, for the purposes of this Directive, assessment of unfair character shall not be made of terms which describe the main subject matter of the contract nor the quality/price ratio  of  the  goods  or  services  supplied;  whereas  the  main subject  matter  of  the  contract  and  the  price/quality  ratio may  nevertheless  be  taken  into  account  in  assessing  the fairness of other terms; whereas it follows, inter alia, that in insurance  contracts,  the  terms  which  clearly  define  or circumscribe the insured risk and the insurer’s liability shall not  be  subject  to  such  assessment  since  these  restrictions are  taken  into  account  in  calculating  the  premium  paid  by the consumer.” 7. Another element of compromise is the so-called “greylist” set out in Schedule 2 to the  1999  Regulations,  exactly  reproducing  the  annex  referred  to  in  Article  3(3)  of  the Directive. This is an “indicative and non-exhaustive list of terms which may be regarded as unfair.” Originally it was proposed as a blacklist of terms which would be conclusively presumed  to  be  unfair.  The  list  contains  17  items,  four  of  which  refer  in  one  way  or another to the monetary consideration paid by the consumer: “(d) permitting the seller or supplier to retain sums paid by the  consumer  where  the  latter  decides  not  to  conclude  or perform the contract, without providing for the consumer to receive  compensation  of  an  equivalent  amount  from  the seller or supplier where the latter is the party cancelling the contract;  (e) requiring any consumer who fails to fulfil his obligation to pay a disproportionately high sum in compensation; (f) authorising the seller or supplier to dissolve the contract on  a  discretionary  basis  where  the  same  facility  is  not granted to the consumer, or permitting the seller or supplier to retain the sums paid for services not yet supplied by him where it is the seller or supplier himself who dissolves the contract;  Page 4 \\x0c            . . . (l) providing for the price of goods to be determined at the time of delivery or allowing a seller of goods or supplier of services to increase their price without in both cases giving the consumer the corresponding right to cancel the contract if the final price is too high in relation to the price agreed when the contract was concluded;” The  basic  test  of  fairness  is  in  Regulation  5(1)  of  the  1999  Regulations, 8. transposing Article 3(1) of the Directive.  Regulation 5(1) provides: “A  contractual  term  which  has  not  been  individually negotiated  shall  be  regarded  as  unfair  if,  contrary  to  the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in  the  parties’  rights  and  obligations  arising  under  the contract, to the detriment of the consumer.” The  consequences  of  unfairness  are  set  out  in  Regulation  8,  transposing  Article  6(1). Regulation 8 provides: “(1)  An  unfair  term  in  a  contract  concluded  with  a consumer by a seller or supplier shall not be binding on the consumer. (2)  The  contract  shall  continue  to  bind  the  parties  if  it  is capable of continuing in existence without the unfair term.” 9. The Court of Justice has not yet had occasion to rule on the scope of Article 4(2). Not all the member states have precisely transposed the Directive into their national laws, since  Article  8  provides  that  they  may  adopt  or  retain  more  stringent  provisions  for consumer  protection,  so  long  as  they  are  compatible  with  the  Treaty.  France  and  Italy, like the United Kingdom, have precisely transposed the Directive. The Netherlands and Spain  have  enacted  more  far-reaching  legislation  affording  greater  protection  to consumers. Germany considered it unnecessary to transpose the Directive in any form, as its national law already offered a greater degree of consumer protection. The First National Bank case  Page 5 \\x0c          10. The Law Lords have already considered Article 4(2) in Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank Plc [2001] UKHL 52, [2002] 1 AC 481. They considered it in the slightly different form in which it was transposed by Regulation 3(2) of the 1994 Regulations: “In  so  far  as  it  is  in  plain,  intelligible  language,  no assessment  shall  be  made  of  the  fairness  of  any  term which— (a) defines the main subject matter of the contract, or (b) concerns the adequacy of the price or remuneration, as against the goods or services sold or supplied.” So  in  the  old  provision  the  words  “in  exchange”  did  not  appear,  and  the  nature  of  the assessment was expressed a little differently. Before your Lordships neither side attached much importance to these points of difference, since the dominant text (as Lord Steyn put it in First National Bank at para 31) is that of the Directive itself. 11. In  First  National  Bank  the  Director  General  of  Fair  Trading  (the  predecessor  of the  OFT,  which  was  established  by  Part  1  of  the  Enterprise  Act  2002)  sought  an injunction  to  restrain  the  bank,  which  was  active  in  the  consumer  credit  market,  from using a standard term under which (on enforcement  of  an  overdue  debt)  interest  was  to continue  to  accrue  at  the  contractual  rate  until  payment  “after  as  well  as  before  any judgment (such obligation to be independent of and not to merge with the judgment)”. At first  instance  Evans-Lombe  J  held  ([2000]  1 WLR  98)  that  the  term  was  a  default  term and not (as the bank’s counsel had submitted) a “core term” within Regulation 3(2) of the 1994 Regulations, but that it was not unfair in the statutory sense. The Court of Appeal ([2000]  QB  672)  allowed  the  Director  General’s  appeal,  agreeing  with  the  judge  as  to Regulation 3(2) but differing as to the fairness of the term. Peter Gibson LJ (giving the judgment of the Court) deprecated the expression “core term” (at p686): “The  test  in  respect  of  the  relevant  term  is  not  whether  it can be called a ‘core term’ but whether it falls within one or both of paragraphs (a) and (b) of Regulation 3(2).” 12. On  a  further  appeal  by  the  bank  the  House  of  Lords  allowed  the  appeal, unanimously  agreeing  with  the  Court  of  Appeal  as  to  the  Court’s  power  to  review  the term, but  unanimously  reversing the Court of  Appeal as to the term’s fairness. The key passages on the scope of Regulation 3(2) of the 1994 Regulations (now Regulation 6(2)  Page 6 \\x0c           of the 1999 Regulations) are para 12 of the opinion of Lord Bingham of Cornhill and para 34 of the opinion of Lord Steyn. 13. Lord Bingham observed in para 12, after references to the then current editions of two leading textbooks (Treitel, The Law of Contract, 10th ed. (1999) p248 and Chitty on Contracts, 28th ed. (1999) para 15-025), “The  object  of  the  Regulations  and  the  Directive  is  to protect  consumers  against  the  inclusion  of  unfair  and prejudicial terms in standard-form contracts into which they enter,  and  that  object  would  plainly  be  frustrated  if Regulation  3(2)(b)  were  so  broadly  interpreted  as  to  cover any terms other than those falling squarely within it. In my opinion  the  term,  as  part  of  a  provision  prescribing  the consequences of default, plainly does not fall within it.” Later in that paragraph Lord Bingham referred to the term as an “ancillary provision.” 14. Lord Steyn observed in para 34: “Clause 8 of the contract, the only provision in dispute, is a default  provision.  It  prescribes  remedies  which  only become  available  to  the  lender  upon  the  default  of  the consumer.  For  this  reason  the  escape  route  of  Regulation 3(2) is not available to the bank. So far as the description of terms covered by Regulation 3(2) as core terms is helpful at all, I would say that clause 8 of the contract is a subsidiary term.  In  any  event,  Regulation  3(2)  must  be  given  a restrictive  interpretation.  Unless  that  is  done  Regulation 3(2)(a)  will  enable  the  main  purpose  of  the  scheme  to  be frustrated by endless formalistic arguments as to whether a provision  is  a  definitional  or  an  exclusionary  provision.  Similarly, Regulation 3(2)(b) dealing with ‘the adequacy of the  price  or  remuneration’  must  be  given  a  restrictive interpretation.  After  all,  in  a  broad  sense  all  terms  of  the the  price  or to contract  are remuneration. That is not what is intended.” in  some  way  related The background and course of this litigation  Page 7 \\x0c          15. A  complaint  of  infringement  of  the  1999  Regulations  may  be  pursued  in proceedings  in  the  county  court  commenced  by  an  individual  consumer  by  reference  to the terms of a particular contract that he or she has entered into. It may also be pursued by the  OFT  which  was  established,  as  already  mentioned,  by  Part  1  of  the  Enterprise  Act 2002 and is a “general enforcer” of “Community infringements” under section 213(1)(a) of that Act  (read with section  212 and  Schedule  13,  para  5).  This  dual  system  (of  what Lord  Steyn,  in  para  33  of  his  opinion  in  First  National  Bank,  referred  to  as  “ex  casu challenges and pre-emptive or collective challenges”) is provided for by Article 7 of the Directive. Both types of challenge form part of the background to this appeal.  As Andrew 16. Smith J put it at first instance (para 2): “The  Relevant  Terms  and  Relevant  Charges  are  being challenged on two fronts: the [OFT] is investigating under the  [1999  Regulations]  the  fairness  of  the  terms  under which  banks  make  such  charges,  and  cases  have  been brought by individual customers in county courts disputing charges levied by banks, many of them relying not only on the 1999 Regulations but also on common law rules about the unenforceability of penalties.” 17. There have, we were told, been many thousands of individual claims in the county courts,  many  brought  by  litigants  in  person  with  the  assistance  of  on-line  forms  and advice.  All or virtually all of these proceedings have been stayed to await the outcome of these proceedings. The volume of litigation speaks for itself as to the dissatisfaction (to use  no  stronger  an  expression)  felt  by  many  thousands  of  customers  affected  by  the challenged charges. 18. In  March  2007,  following  complaints  made  to  it,  the  OFT  started  a  formal investigation of the fairness of terms relating to overdraft charges (these were referred to in  the  pleadings  and  in  the  lower  courts  as  “the  Relevant  Terms”  and  “the  Relevant Charges” and it is convenient to adopt the same terminology).  At the same time the OFT began a market study in order to consider (in the words of the first witness statement of Mr Cavendish Elithorn, a senior director of the OFT) “wider questions about competition and value for money in the provision of personal current accounts in the UK, such as: (a) the  low  levels  of  cost  transparency  and;  (b)  the  ease  with  which  consumers  can  switch accounts.” At an early stage of the investigation the banks raised a preliminary objection based  on  Regulation  6(2)  of  the  1999  Regulations.  The  same  issue  had  been  raised  in many individual claims in the county courts.    Page 8 \\x0c        19. In order to resolve the issue, and in accordance with written agreements reached between  the  OFT  and  the  banks,  the  OFT  on  27  July  2007  issued  proceedings  in  the Commercial Court seeking a declaration that Regulation 6(2) did not apply to the banks’ Relevant Terms then current.  The banks, in order to obtain a more comprehensive answer covering  related  issues  raised  in  individual  claims,  counterclaimed  not  only  for declarations  to  the  opposite  effect  to  those  sought  by  the  OFT  (including  an  express declaration as to plain and intelligible language) but also for further declarations that their Relevant  Terms  were  not  capable  of  amounting  to  a  penalty  at  common  law,  and declarations relating to “good faith” under regulation 5(1).  These issues were raised both in relation to the banks’ then current sets of terms and in relation to terms which were no longer  current.  The  judge  heard  argument  only  on  the  then  current  terms,  for  case management reasons.  But our decision is likely to cover almost all the “historic” terms as well.  We  were  told  that  the  OFT  and  the  banks  have  so  far  been  able  to  agree  that  the lower courts’ decisions on the current terms should be treated as applicable to the historic terms as well. 20. In  these  circumstances  Andrew  Smith  J  had  three  groups  of  issues  to  decide: issues  as  to  Regulation  6(2)  (including  particular  issues  as  to  “plain  intelligible language”); issues as to Regulation 5(1); and issues as to common law penalties. He gave judgment on 24 April 2008 after 14 days of hearings during January and February 2008.  His judgment  ([2008] EWHC 875 (Comm),  [2008]  2  All  ER (Comm)  625)  runs  to  450 paragraphs and the Court of Appeal rightly paid tribute to its quality and clarity. In brief, the judge decided the issues as follows (the paragraph numbers specified below being the conclusions at the end of the relevant discussion): on  the  first  group  of  issues,  that  the  Relevant  Terms  were  in  plain (1) intelligible  language  except  (in  the  case  of  four  banks)  “in  certain  specific  and relatively minor respects” (para 293); that they were not exempt under Regulation 6(2)  from  assessment  in  point  of  fairness  (para  421);  and  that  the  “excluded assessment” construction was correct (para 436); that  none  of  the  terms  amounted  to  the  imposition  of  a  common  law that  it  was  inappropriate  to  give  any  declaratory  relief  as  regards (2) penalty (para 323); and (3) Regulation 5(1) (para 447). 21. The  banks  appealed,  with  the  permission  of  the  judge,  against  the  decision  that Regulation 6(2) did not apply to the Relevant Charges. The judge refused permission to the four relevant banks on the “plain intelligible language” issue. The OFT did not seek to appeal  but  put  in  a  respondent’s  notice  with  further  grounds  for  supporting  the  judge’s decision on Regulation 6(2). The argument in the Court of Appeal was therefore mainly focused on the scope of Regulation 6(2). The Court of Appeal (Sir Anthony Clarke MR, Lord  Justice  Waller  V-P  and  Lloyd  LJ),  in  a  judgment  of  the  Court  delivered  on  26 February 2009 by the Master of the Rolls ([2009] EWCA Civ 116), dismissed the banks’  Page 9 \\x0c          appeal  for  reasons  which  the  Court  described  (para  112)  as  “somewhat  broader”  than those  of  the  judge.  The  Court  refused  to  extend  the  permission  to  appeal  to  the  “plain intelligible language” issue. The banks’ further appeal to the House of Lords (with leave granted  on  31  March  2009)  was  heard  in  June  2009  but  our  judgment  is  (under transitional  provisions  in  the  Constitutional  Reform  Act  2005  and  the  Supreme  Court Rules) a judgment of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The Relevant Terms and Charges 22. It  will  be  necessary  to  come  back  to  a  detailed  consideration  of  the  Court  of Appeal’s reasoning, which Mr Sumption has subjected to robust criticism. But I must first say more about the Relevant Terms and the Relevant Charges of the banks. They are the material to which Regulation 6(2), properly construed, has to be applied.   23. The  Relevant  Terms  and  the  Relevant  Charges  were  covered  in  detail  in  the pleadings, and annexes to the pleadings. There is a clear summary in annexes B-E to the OFT’s joint reply and defence to the counterclaims. The judge gave a general description of the operation of current accounts and authorised and unauthorised overdrafts (paras 42-82). He then (in order to deal with a range of questions as to plain intelligible language) covered a mass of detail in a masterly fashion. His summaries of the eight banks’ terms and  charges  starts  with  Abbey  National  (paras  130-154)  and  ends  with  Royal  Bank  of Scotland (paras 274-292).  This part of his judgment has not been challenged in any way, and the Court of Appeal adopted it. For present purposes it is sufficient to set out the summary in paras 7 and 8 of the 24. Statement of Facts and Issue agreed by the parties: “There  are  four  basic  categories  of  Relevant  Charges,  as defined  in  the  Judgments  below,  not  all  of  which  are charged  by  all  Banks:  Unpaid  Item  Charges;  Paid  Item Charges;  Overdraft  Excess  Charges;  and  Guaranteed  Paid Item Charges.  An  ‘Unpaid  Item  Charge’  is  levied  when  the a. customer gives an instruction for payment or, in some cases at  least  withdrawal,  that  the  bank  declines  to  honour because the customer does not have sufficient funds in his account or an arranged facility which covers it.  Page 10 \\x0c       A  ‘Paid  Item  Charge’  is  levied  when  the  customer b. gives  an  instruction  for  payment  or,  in  some  cases  at  least withdrawal, for which he does not have sufficient funds in his  account,  or  an  arranged  facility  which  covers  it,  and which the bank honours. c. A ‘Guaranteed Paid Item Charge’ refers to a charge distinct from a Paid Item Charge which some of the banks levy when they honour, in accordance with the guarantee, a cheque issued in conjunction with a cheque guarantee card (or, in the case of some banks, a debit card payment made under  a  guaranteed  debit  payment  system)  for  which  the customer  does  not  have  sufficient  funds  or  a  sufficient arranged facility. An ‘Overdraft Excess Charge’ is levied if, during a d. specified period (typically a day or a month) an account is and/or  goes  overdrawn  (and  there  is  no  overdraft  facility), or  the  debit  balance  is  and/or  goes  above  the  limit  on  an existing overdraft facility.    Annexed  hereto  are  summaries  (one  for  each  bank)  that identify  the  relevant  contractual  documents,  the  Relevant Terms  and  the  Relevant  Charges.  In  all  cases,  there  is  a ‘terms  and  conditions’  document,  and  an  accompanying leaflet  or  tariff,  which  it  is  the  Banks’  practice  to  make available to the customer as part of the process of opening the account. This litigation assumes the incorporation of the Relevant  Terms  into  the  contract  between  the  Banks  and their  respective  customers.  The  Banks’  standard  rates  of interest and charges are usually set out in the tariff/leaflet.  Prior  notice  of  any  material  changes  in  the  tariff  (or  terms generally) has to be given to the customer under the terms of  the  Banking  Code  to  which  the  Banks  voluntarily subscribe.” The opposing arguments in summary 25. The  appeal  has  been  argued  with  conspicuous  clarity  and  skill  by  Mr  Sumption and  Mr  Vos  QC  (the  latter  instructed  on  behalf  of  Nationwide)  for  the  banks  and  Mr  Page 11 \\x0c         Crow  for  the  OFT.  This  brief  summary  is  no  more  than  a  sketch  drawing  attention  to some salient points.   26. The general thrust of Mr Sumption’s submissions for the banks was that both the judge  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  had  adopted  an  over-complicated  approach  to  an  issue which, however important both for the consumers and for the banks, is ultimately quite a short point of construction. Article 4(2) of the Directive, now transposed by Regulation 6(2) of the 1999 Regulations, is expressed in fairly simple and non-technical language, as is  appropriate  for  a  Community  measure  which  has  to  be  applied  across  a  variety  of national  systems  of  contract  law.  It  represents  a  compromise  between  consumer protection  and  freedom  of  contract.  The  courts  below,  in  seeking  to  identify  and  give effect to the underlying purpose of the Directive, misread Regulation 6(2) as concerned (in paragraph (b) as well as in paragraph (a)) only with what was a “core” or “essential” part  of  the  bargain,  to  which  the  consumer  may  be  supposed  to  have  consented  in  a meaningful sense.  The courts below had overlooked that “core term”, if that expression is to  be  used  at  all,  must  be  understood  as  no  more  than  shorthand  for  the  contents  of paragraphs  (a)  and  (b).  Mr  Vos  supplemented  Mr  Sumption’s  submissions  by  what  he referred to as the “debit/credit argument”, which focuses on the fact that customers who incur Relevant Charges will view the essence of their contract with the bank differently from those customers who never (or rarely) incur those charges. 27. Against  that  Mr  Crow’s  primary  submission  was  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  had reached  the  right  conclusion  for  the  right  reasons.  The  fairness  of  payment  obligations falling  within  Regulation  6(2)(b)  is  exempt  from  assessment  in  point  of  “adequacy” (appropriateness) only if they form part of the essential bargain between the parties. The essential bargain constitutes only so much of the contract as the consumer can be said to have  consented  to  freely.  The  banks  had  misunderstood  the  travaux  préparatoires  and drawn the wrong conclusion  from  them. The Court of Appeal’s  decision  was supported by  the  decision  of  the  House  of  Lords  in  First  National  Bank.    The  Relevant  Charges were ancillary payment obligations and were not incurred in the normal performance of the  contract.  The  typical  consumer  would  not  clearly  recognise  them  as  the  price  of services supplied by the banks in exchange. The Court of Appeal's reasoning 28. It  is  therefore  necessary  for  the  Court  to  look  closely  at  the  Court  of  Appeal’s reasoning. The general structure of the reasoning on the construction issue is a summary, with  some  discussion,  of  the  judge’s  main  conclusions  (paras  12  to  22);  discussion  of First  National  Bank  (paras  40  to  58),  the  travaux  préparatoires  (paras  59  to  69), academic writings (paras 70 to 80) and the relevant principles and the Court’s conclusions on the issue of construction (paras 81 to 92). This is followed by a relatively short section (paras 93 to 112) applying the Court’s conclusions to the facts.  Page 12 \\x0c           29. The first point to note (in order to get it out of the way) is the Court’s treatment of the “excluded terms/excluded assessment” controversy which the judge had dealt with at some length. This point arose on the wording of Regulation 3(2) of the 1994 Regulations (and may have been one of the reasons for their replacement). It may appear an abstract point  but  it  is  potentially  of  great  practical  importance,  as  Lord  Phillips  explains  in  his judgment (paras 60 and 61). The judge put the issue in these terms (para 422): “If Regulation 6(2)(b) applies to a term, is any assessment of its fairness excluded (the ‘excluded term’ construction), or does the Regulation exclude only an assessment relating to  the  adequacy  of  the  price  (the  ‘excluded  assessment’ construction)?” He  decided  in  favour  of  the  “excluded  assessment”  construction  and  that  was  not challenged  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  or  before  this  Court.  Mr  Sumption  described  it  as  a distraction.  For  present  purposes,  I  am  inclined  to  agree.  The  precise  nature  of  the exercise in assessing the fairness of a reviewable term is no more than marginally relevant to deciding whether or not a term is reviewable in the first place. But in the long run it may become an issue of great practical importance. 30. The  Court  of  Appeal  then  addressed  the  issue  whether  paras  (a)  and  (b)  of Regulation  6(2)  should  be  construed  conjunctively  (as  the  OFT  had  argued  before  the judge) or disjunctively (as the banks had argued). The judge decided that they should be construed disjunctively.  The Court of Appeal commented (para 15): “The  OFT  does  not  challenge  his  decision.  We  do  not therefore express a different view, although in our opinion it  is  important  to  construe  paragraph  (b)  of  Regulation 6(2)(b)  in  the  context  of  the  whole  of  the  Regulation including paragraph (a).” Here the Court of Appeal was,  I  think, putting down a marker for what was  to become one of the most important themes in its decision. 31. I  have  to  say  that  I  do  not  find  it  particularly  helpful  to  consider  whether paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  should  be  read  conjunctively  or  disjunctively.  The  Court  is  not faced  with  a  text  (such  as  “charitable  or  benevolent”  in  the  will  of  Caleb  Diplock: Chichester  Diocesan  Fund  &  Board  of  Finance  v  Simpson  [1944]  AC  341,  349,  369) where the two approaches are stark alternatives. In my view the two paragraphs must be  Page 13 \\x0c           given their natural meaning, and read in that way they set out tests which are separate but not unconnected. They reflect (but in slightly different ways) the two sides (or quid pro quo) of any consumer contract, that is (a) what it is that the trader is to sell or supply and (b) what it is that the consumer is to pay for what he gets. The definition of the former is not  to  be  reviewed  in  point  of  fairness,  nor  is  the  “adequacy”  (appropriateness)  of  the latter. 32. The Court of Appeal then discussed First National Bank at some length, focusing (entirely correctly, in my opinion) on Lord Bingham’s and Lord Steyn’s description of the relevant  clause  as  a  default  provision.  The  Court  also  focused  on  Lord  Bingham’s description of it as “ancillary” and Lord Steyn’s description of it as “subsidiary.” That led to what I regard as a more questionable conclusion (para 49): “As we see it, it follows from the reasoning of the House of Lords that what article 4(2) of the Directive was seeking to exclude  from  the  assessment  required  by  the  national authorities (here the OFT) was the core bargain or the core price  but  not  ancillary  or  incidental  provisions.  In  our judgment,  Regulation  6(2)  of  the  1999  Regulations  should be construed with that underlying purpose in mind.” The Court went on similarly (para 52): “In  our  view  these  considerations  support  the  conclusion that  the  purpose  of  Regulation  6(2)(b)  was  to  limit  the exclusion to the essence of the price, just as the purpose of Regulation 6(2)(a) was to limit it to the main subject matter of  the  contract.  As  appears  below,  the  reason  for  the limitation  was  to  reflect  the  fact  that  the  parties  would  be likely  to  (or  might  well)  negotiate  the  main  subject  matter of the contract and the essential price but not the detail.” The  considerations  referred  to  were  that  Regulation  6(2)(b)  referred  to  “the  price  or remuneration” and not to part of the price or remuneration. This impressed both the judge and the Court of Appeal. I do not see much  force in it, as the Directive is expressed in terse, simple language, and the 1999 Regulations follow the same style.  Page 14 \\x0c           33. This part of the Court of Appeal’s reasoning ends with a firm conclusion.  After approving  the  judge’s  reliance  on  passages  in  successive  editions  of  Treitel  (11th  ed. (2003) p273 and 12th ed. (2007) para 7-101) the Court went on (para 55): “This  last  point  is  of  some  importance  because  the  Banks submit  that,  once  the  conjunctive  construction  has  been rejected, there is no room to apply the principle of essential bargain to price clauses, if only because of the difficulty in deciding  to  which  it  applies  and  to  which  it  does  not.  We are not able to accept that submission. We accept the OFT’s submission that it all depends upon the circumstances of the particular  case  and  that  it  is  a  question  of  fact  whether  a clause which might otherwise fall to be assessed is outside the essential bargain between the parties.” 34. The Court found support for this not only in First National Bank but also in the travaux  and  in  some  academic  writings.  It  identified  the  purpose  of  the  Article  4(2) exception as being (para 69) that standard form contracts should be subjected to a test of fairness  except  so  far  as  their  terms  have  been  negotiated  (the  implication  being  that  it was  essential  terms,  both  as  to  specification  and  as  to  price,  that  a  consumer  would actually negotiate).  Therefore (para 69 (iii)): “Ancillary  or  incidental  price,  remuneration  or  payment terms  will  not  fall  within  the  exception  in  article  4(2) because they do not fulfil the purpose or essential rationale of the exception.” The Court noted that a similar view had been taken in a Joint Consultation Paper issued in 2001 by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission (though paragraph 3.32 of the Paper, set out in para 79 of the judgment, is expressed in terms of understanding rather than consent).  35. The next section of the judgment contains a discussion of the relevant principles of  construction  followed  by  a  restatement  of  the  conclusion  that  the  Court  had  already reached (para 86): “The  question  is  whether  to  import  the  notion  of  essential bargain  into  the  construction  of  article  4(2)  and  into  both paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  of  Regulation  6(2).  Our  answer  to  Page 15 \\x0c          that  question  is  yes,  essentially  for  the  reasons  we  have already given when discussing the First National Bank case and the travaux préparatoires. We would summarise them in much the same way as Mr Crow did in the course of the oral argument: (i) The concept of the essential bargain flows naturally from the  structure  of  the  Directive,  from  the  purpose  of  the Directive, from the purpose of the exemption and from the decision in the First National Bank case.” These points are then elaborated in (ii), (iii) and (iv). 36. The Court of Appeal then went on to consider whether the Relevant Terms and the Relevant Charges were or formed part of the essential or core bargain between the parties. The Court recorded (para 99) fifteen points made by Mr Crow, the general thrust of which was that an unauthorised overdraft was something to which a customer was not entitled; it was  exceptional  and  unnecessary;  in  consequence  Relevant  Charges  were  contingent, uneconomic, unadvertised and imperfectly understood. Against this Mr Vos (leading the banks’  submissions  in  response  to  the  fifteen  points  made  by  Mr  Crow)  pointed  (para 101) to the banks having earned £2.56bn from Relevant Charges in 2006 (against £4.1bn in  net  interest  earned  on  accounts  in  credit)  and  to  over  12  million  customers  who  had incurred  Relevant  Charges  in  that  year.  The  majority  of  these  incurred  more  than  one Relevant Charge. In the circumstances it was wrong, Mr Vos submitted, to say that they were isolated incidents. It was a misuse of language to describe unarranged borrowing as an exception to an exception. The Court concluded (para 104): “We  say  at  once  that  there  is  undoubted  force  in  these submissions  but  we  have  nevertheless the conclusion  that,  when  all  the  circumstances  are  taken  into account,  the  Relevant  Charges  are  not  part  of  the  core  or essential  bargain  in  the  sense  that  that  concept  has  been used in the sources to which we have referred.” reached The appeal was therefore dismissed. 37. The  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  was  followed  by  Mann  J.  in Office  of  Fair Trading  v  Foxtons  Ltd  [2009]  EWHC  1681  (Ch),  10  July  2009.  We  received  written submissions on this decision. The submissions vary markedly in their perceptions of how easily and satisfactorily the judge applied the Court of Appeal’s test (which was of course  Page 16 \\x0c          binding on him). I do not think it necessary to go further into the decision, especially as the relevant term was in any event not in plain intelligible language. The meaning of Regulation 6(2) 38. After  considering  the  judgments  of  Andrew  Smith  J  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  at length I am impressed, as no doubt all of us are, by the great care with which both courts have considered all the arguments and materials put before them. But I must respectfully say that I see force in Mr Sumption’s criticisms of their approach as over-elaborate. The issue is a very important one, but it is essentially quite a short point, even when all the elements relevant to a purposive approach to construction are taken into account. I also respectfully think that the courts below, although cautioning themselves that “core terms” is  a  shorthand  expression  for  the  contents  of  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  of  regulation  6(2), tended  to  slip  into  treating  it  as  an  autonomous  expression  which  itself  expressed  the contents of both those paragraphs. 39. I  start  with  the  language  of  Article  4(2)  and  Regulation  6(2)  (I  can  see  no significant difference between them, although for no obvious reason Article 4(2) refers to assessing  the  unfair  nature  of  a  term  whereas  Regulation  6(2)  refers  to  assessment  of fairness  of  a  term).  Paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  are,  as  I  have  said,  concerned  with  the  two sides of the quid pro quo inherent in any consumer contract. The main subject-matter may be goods or services.  If it is goods, it may be a single item (a car or a dishwasher) or a multiplicity  of  items.  If  for  instance  a  consumer  orders  a  variety  of  goods  from  a  mail-order  catalogue  –  say  clothing,  blinds,  kitchen  utensils  and  toys  –  there  is  no  possible basis  on  which  the  court  can  decide  that  some  items  are  more  essential  to  the  contract than others.  The main subject matter is simply consumer goods ordered from a catalogue. I think that the Court of Appeal was wrong (para 55) to dismiss the difficulties raised by the banks on this point as something that the court could decide as a question of fact in the circumstances of the particular case. 40. Similarly, a supply of services may be simple (an entertainer booked to perform for an hour at a children’s party) or composite (a week’s stay at a five-star hotel offering a wide  variety  of  services).  Again,  there  is  no  principled  basis  on  which  the  court  could decide  that  some  services  are  more  essential  to  the  contract  than  others  and  again  the main subject matter must be described in general terms—hotel services. The services that banks  offer  to  their  current  account  customers  are  a  comparable  package  of  services. These include the collection and payment of cheques, other money transmission services, facilities  for  cash  distribution  (mainly  by  ATM  machines  either  at  manned  branches  or elsewhere) and the provision of statements in printed or electronic form.  Page 17 \\x0c        41.  When one turns to the other part of the quid pro quo of a consumer contract, the price  or  remuneration,  the  difficulty  of  deciding  which  prices  are  essential  is  just  the same,  and  Regulation  6(2)(b)  contains  no  indication  that  only  an  “essential”  price  or remuneration is relevant.  Any monetary price or remuneration payable under the contract would  naturally  fall  within  the  language  of  paragraph  (b)  (I  discount  the  absence  of  a reference to part of the price or remuneration for reasons already mentioned). 42. In the case of banking services supplied to a current account customer under the “free  if  in  credit”  regime,  the  principal  monetary  consideration  received  by  the  bank consists  of  interest  and  charges  on  authorised  and  unauthorised  overdrafts,  and  specific charges  for  particular  non-routine  services  (such  as  expedited  or  foreign  money transmission  services).  The  most  important  element  of  the  consideration,  however, consists of the interest forgone by customers whose current accounts are in credit, since whether their credit balance is large or small, they will be receiving a relatively low rate of interest on it (sometimes a very low rate or no interest at all). The scale of this benefit is  indicated  by  the  figure  for  2006  already  mentioned.  Mr  Sumption  was  wary  about committing himself as to whether interest foregone constituted part of the bank’s price or remuneration for the purposes of Regulation 6(2)(b). Whatever view is taken as to that, it is clear that just as banking services to current account customers can aptly be described as a package, so can the consideration that moves from the customer to the bank. Interest forgone is an important part of that package for customers whose accounts are in credit, and  overdraft  interest  and  charges  are  the  most  important  element  for  those  customers who  are  not  in  credit.  Lawyers  are  very  used  to  speaking  of  a  package  (or  bundle)  of rights and obligations, and in that sense every obligation which a consumer undertakes by a  consumer  contract  could  be  seen  as  part  of  the  price  or  remuneration  received  by  the supplier. But non-monetary obligations undertaken by a consumer contract (for instance, to take proper care of goods on hire-purchase, or to treat material supplied for a distance-learning course as available only to the customer personally) are not part of the “price or remuneration”  within  the  Regulation.  That  is  the  point  of  Lord  Steyn’s  observation  in First  National  Bank,  in  para  34,  that  “in  a  broad  sense  all  terms  of  the  contract  are  in some way related to the price or remuneration.” 43. This House’s decision in First National Bank shows that not every term that is in some  way  linked  to  monetary  consideration  falls  within  Regulation  6(2)(b).    Paras  (d), (e), (f) and (l) of the “greylist” in Schedule 2 to the 1999 Regulations are an illustration of that. But the relevant term in First National Bank was a default provision. Traders ought not to be able to outflank consumers by “drafting themselves” into a position where they can take advantage of a default provision.  But Bairstow Eves London Central Ltd v Smith [2004] 2 EGLR 25 shows that the Court can and will be astute to prevent that. In First National Bank Lord Steyn indicated that what is now Regulation 6(2) should be construed restrictively, and Lord Bingham said that it should be limited to terms “falling squarely within it”. I respectfully agree. But in my opinion the Relevant Terms and the Relevant Charges do fall squarely within Regulation 6(2)(b).  Page 18 \\x0c        44. That  conclusion  is  not  to  my  mind  at  variance  with  the  message  to  be  derived from  the  travaux.  It  is  a  fairly  complex  message,  reflecting  not  only  a  compromise between the opposing aims of consumer protection and freedom of contract, but also the contrast between consumer protection and consumer choice (the latter being more central, perhaps,  to  basic  Community  principles).  This  point  was  explored  and  explained  in  an article  (not  mentioned  by  the  Court  of  Appeal)  to  which  Mr  Sumption  referred,  that  is Good Faith in European Contract Law by Professor Hugh Collins, (1994) 14 OJLS 229. Mr Sumption placed particular emphasis on the following passage: “The  history  of  the  EC  Directive  on  Unfair  Terms  in Consumer Contracts reveals the struggle between these two interpretations  of  the  economic  interests  of  consumers.  Even at a late stage in the negotiations, the draft Directive proposed by the Commission envisaged the introduction of a  general  principle  against  substantive  unfairness in consumer  contracts.  It  invalidated  terms  in  standard  form consumer  contracts  which  caused  ‘the  performance  of  the contract  to  be  significantly  different  from  what  the consumer  could  legitimately  expect’,  or  which  caused  ‘the performance of the contract to be unduly detrimental to the consumer’.  But  in  the  battle  between  the  advocates  of consumer  rights  and  the  supporters  of  free  competition, eventually  the  latter  emerged  victorious  in  the  Council  of Ministers.  The fairness of the transaction in the sense of the price paid for the goods or services should not be subjected to  review  or  control.  This  is  the  meaning  of  the  obscure Article 4(2) [which is then set out]. The final reservation in this  provision  [‘plain  intelligible  language’]  is  significant.  The  Directive  does  not  require  consumer  contracts  to  be substantively  fair,  but  it  does  require  them  to  be  clear.  Clarity is  essential  for  effective  market  competition between terms. What matters primarily for EC contract law is consumer choice, not consumer rights.” 45. The Court of Appeal took account of the travaux and of some academic writing. It recognised  as  an  underlying  value  the  notion  that  freedom  of  contract  should  prevail where there has been meaningful negotiation between supplier and consumer, so that the latter does consent to the terms of the contract. But I respectfully think the Court went too far in interpreting the language of the Directive and the 1999 Regulations in order to meet that  perceived  aim.  The  Directive  and  the  1999  Regulations  apply  only  to  terms  which have not been individually negotiated, and the Court departed from the natural meaning of the text in order to achieve an unnecessary duplication of the exception for individually negotiated terms.    Page 19 \\x0c         46. I would add a postscript to this part of the discussion. A variety of expressions has been used, in the courts below and in argument (and to some extent by this House in First National Bank), to describe those contractual terms which are subject to review in point of  fairness:  ancillary,  subordinate,  incidental,  non-core,  collateral.  These  may  all  be  of some  assistance  but  it  is  important,  in  considering  provisions  which  apply  across  an extraordinarily wide range of consumer contracts, to treat them with caution. I venture to repeat a paragraph from an opinion of mine (in which the other members of the Appellate Committee  concurred)  in  College  of  Estate  Management  v  Customs  &  Excise Commissioners [2005] STC 1957, para 30, an appeal raising questions of Community law about whether there is a single or multiple supply, and whether it is of goods or services, for the purposes of value added tax: in  British  Telecommunications  (where “‘Ancillary’  means  (as  Ward  LJ  rightly  observed  ([2004] STC 1471 at [39]) subservient, subordinate and ministering to  something  else.  It  was  an  entirely  apposite  term  in  the discussion the delivery of the car was subordinate to its sale) and in Card Protection  Plan  itself  (where  some  peripheral  parts  of  a package of services, and some goods of trivial value such as labels, key tabs and a medical card, were subordinate to the main  package  of  insurance  services).  But  there  are  other cases (including Faaborg, Beynon and the present case) in which it is inappropriate to analyse the transaction in terms of what is ‘principal’ and ‘ancillary’, and it is unhelpful to strain the natural meaning of ‘ancillary’ in an attempt to do so.  Food  is  not  ancillary  to  restaurant  services;  it  is  of central and indispensable importance to them; nevertheless (Faaborg). supply  of there Pharmaceuticals  are  not  ancillary  to  medical  care  which requires  the  use  of  medication;  again,  they  are  of  central and indispensable importance; nevertheless there is a single supply of services (Beynon).” services single is  a Conversely, delivery of goods or peripheral extras may be disregarded as ancillary for the purposes  of  para  (a)  of  Regulation  6(2),  but  the  charges  for  them,  if  payable  under  the same contract, are part of the price for the purposes of para (b). The application of Regulation 6(2) 47. I can state my opinion much more briefly on the second main issue in the appeal, that  is  the  application  of  Regulation  6(2),  properly  construed,  to  the  facts.  Charges  for unauthorised  overdrafts  are  monetary  consideration  for  the  package  of  banking  services supplied to personal current account customers. They are an important part of the banks’  Page 20 \\x0c          charging  structure,  amounting  to  over  30  per  cent  of  their  revenue  stream  from  all personal current account customers. The facts that the charges are contingent, and that the majority  of  customers  do  not  incur  them,  are  irrelevant.  On  the  view  that  I  take  of  the construction of Regulation 6(2), the fairness of the charges would be exempt from review in point of appropriateness under Regulation 6(2)(b) even if fewer customers paid them, and  they  formed  a  smaller  part  of  the  banks’  revenue  stream.  Even  if  the  Court  of Appeal’s  interpretation  had  been  correct,  I  do  not  see  how  it  could  have  come  to  the conclusion that charges amounting to over 30 per cent of the revenue stream were (para 111) “not part of the core or essential bargain.” Should there be a reference under Article 234? 48. This  Court,  as  the  national  court  of  last  resort,  is  under  an  obligation  to  make  a reference  to  the  Court  of  Justice  under  Article  234  of  the  Treaty  if  a  decision  on  the correct interpretation of the Directive is necessary to enable the Court to give judgment, and  the  point  is  not  acte  clair.  Neither  side  showed  any  enthusiasm  for  a  reference, because of the further delay that would be occasioned in a very large number of claims at present stayed. The Court is entitled to take the likely delay into account, although not as an overriding consideration, in deciding whether to make a reference. 49. If (as I understand to be the case) the Court is unanimous that the appeal should be allowed,  then  in  my  opinion  we  should  treat  the  point  as  acte  clair,  and  decide  against making a reference. It may seem paradoxical for a court of last resort to conclude that a point  is  clear  when  it  is  differing  from  the  carefully-considered  judgments  of  the  very experienced  judges who  have  ruled on it in lower courts. But sometimes a court of last resort  does  conclude,  without  any  disrespect,  that  the  lower  courts  were  clearly  wrong, and in my respectful opinion this is such a case. 50. Even if some or all of the Court feel that the point is not acte clair, I would still propose  that  we ought  not to incur the  delay involved in a reference under Article 234, since a decision on the correct construction of Article 4(2) of the Directive is not essential for the determination of this appeal. The correct construction of Article 4(2) is a question of Community law, but the application of the Article, properly construed, to the facts is a question for national law. Even if the Court of Appeal was not clearly wrong on the issue of construction, it was in my respectful opinion clearly wrong in applying its construction to the facts. In other circumstances it might be regarded as rather unprincipled to take that means of avoiding an important issue of Community law, but in the special circumstances of this case I would regard it as the lesser of two evils.  There is a strong public interest in resolving the matter without further delay. Conclusion  Page 21 \\x0c           51. For these reasons I would allow the appeal. The declaration sought by the banks in their  counterclaims  is  inappropriate  for  the  reasons  explained  by  Lord  Phillips  at  the beginning  of  his  judgment.  I  would  declare  that  the  bank  charges  levied  on  personal current  account  customers  in  respect  of  unauthorised  overdrafts  (including  unpaid  item charges  and  other  related  charges)  constitute  part  of  the  price  or  remuneration  for  the banking services provided and, in so far as the terms giving rise to the charges are in plain intelligible  language,  no  assessment  under  the  Unfair  Terms  in  Consumer  Contracts Regulations 1999 of the fairness of those terms may relate to their adequacy as against the services supplied. 52. If the Court allows this appeal the outcome may cause great disappointment and indeed  dismay  to  a  very  large  number  of  bank  customers  who  feel  that  they  have  been subjected to unfairly high charges in respect of unauthorised overdrafts. But this decision is not the end of the matter, as Lord Phillips explains in his judgment. Moreover Ministers and  Parliament  may  wish  to  consider  the  matter  further.  They  decided,  in  an  era  of  so-called “light-touch” regulation, to transpose the Directive as it stood rather than to confer the  higher  degree  of  consumer  protection  afforded  by  the  national  laws  of  some  other member states. Parliament may wish to consider whether to revisit that decision. LORD PHILLIPS  Introduction 53. In  common  with  most  members  of  the  public  all  members  of  the  Court  have  a current  account  with  one  or  other  of  the  appellants  (“the  Banks”).  The  Banks  and  the Respondent (“the OFT”) have agreed that we should none the less hear this appeal. The operation  of  a  current  account  by  a  Bank  for  its  customer  involves  the  provision  of  a number of different services. These include the collection of cheques drawn in favour of the customer, the honouring of cheques drawn by the customer, payments on behalf of the customer pursuant to the use by the customer of credit or debit cards and cash distribution facilities.  54. The  customer  rewards  his  Bank  for  the  provision  of  these  services  in  different ways, in accordance with standard terms agreed between the customer and the Bank.  The majority  of  customers,  who  always  keep  their  accounts  in  credit,  reward  the  Bank  by allowing it to use the funds standing to their credit without paying interest at the market rate. Somewhat misleadingly, the services provided by Banks to such customers are said to  be  “free  of  charge”.  The  position  is  very  different  in  the  case  of  a  customer  who permits his current account to go into debit without having obtained, in advance, authority  Page 22 \\x0c           from  his  Bank  to  overdraw.  When  this  occurs,  the  customer  becomes  liable  to  pay charges.  In  some  instances  the  charge  will  be  triggered  by  the  performance  of  an individual  identifiable  service,  such  as  honouring  a  cheque.  In  other  instances  a  sum becomes  payable  if,  during  a  specified  period,  an  account  is  overdrawn.  These  charges have collectively been described in this litigation as “the Relevant Charges” and the terms under  which  they  are  imposed  as  “the  Relevant  Terms”.  I  shall  adopt  that  terminology. Mr Sumption QC, who appeared for the Banks, preferred to call the charges “Insufficient Fund Charges”. Lord Walker has, in his judgment, explained the background to this litigation and 55. set  out  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Unfair  Terms  in  Consumer  Contracts  Regulations 1999  SI  1999/2083  (“the  1999  Regulations”)  and  Council  Directive  93/13/EEC  (“the Directive”),  which  the  1999  Regulations  implemented.  Subject  to  one  exception  I  shall not repeat that exercise.  The OFT is minded to attack the Relevant Terms under the 1999 Regulations on 56. the  ground  that  they  are  unfair.  The  Banks  contend  that  any  such  attack  will  be circumscribed  by  the  provisions  of  Regulation  6(2)  of  the  1999  Regulations,  which provides: “In  so  far  as  it  is  in  plain  intelligible  language,  the assessment of fairness of a term shall not relate- to  the  definition  of  the  main  subject  matter  of  the (a) contract, or  to  the  adequacy  of  the  price  or  remuneration,  as (b) against the goods or services supplied in exchange”. It is common ground that the Relevant Terms that are the subject of this appeal are largely in  plain  intelligible  language  except  (in  the  case  of  four  banks)  in  certain  specific  and relatively minor respects. The agreed Statement of Facts and Issue describes the issue raised by this appeal The issue 57. as follows:   Page 23 \\x0c          “Whether  an  assessment  of  the  fairness  of  the  Relevant Terms (pursuant to which the Relevant Charges are levied) would relate to the adequacy of the price and remuneration, as  against  the  services  supplied  in  exchange,  within  the meaning  of  regulation  6(2)(b)  of  the  Unfair  Terms  in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.” This  does  not  accurately  describe  the  issue  raised  by  this  appeal,  which  is  very  much more  narrow.  That  issue  is  whether  the  Relevant  Charges  constitute  “the  price  or remuneration,  as  against  the  services  supplied  in  exchange”  within  the  meaning  of  the Regulation. If they do not, the attack on the fairness of the terms that is open to the OFT will  not  be  circumscribed  by  Regulation  6(2)(b).  If  they  do,  they  will  still  be  open  to attack by the OFT on the ground that they are “unfair” as defined by Regulation 5(1), but that attack cannot be founded on an allegation that the Relevant Charges are excessive by comparison  with  the  services  which  they  purchase,  for  that  is  forbidden  by  Regulation 6(2)(b). That this was indeed the issue was made clear by counsel on either side in their 58. oral submissions. Towards the close of his reply, Mr Sumption QC said this: “All  that  I  can  ask  the  courts  to  declare,  and  all  that  my clients  have  ever  asked  the  courts  to  declare,  is  that  the insufficient  fund  charges  are  included  in  the  price  within the meaning of the word “price” in [Regulation] 6 and that no  assessment  of  the  fairness  of  the  terms  imposing  the IFCs  may  relate  to  their  adequacy  as  against  the  service supplied.” 59.  Mr Crow QC for his part submitted on behalf of the OFT that even if Article 4(2) of  the  Directive  did  apply,  the  Relevant  Terms  were  still  subject  to  assessment  for fairness. In that event, while it would not be open to the OFT to assess the fairness of the price by reference to the adequacy of the goods or services supplied in exchange, it would be open to the OFT to assess the fairness of the price according to other criteria. 60. This agreement between the parties reflects acceptance by the Banks in the Court of Appeal of a finding by Andrew Smith J that was contrary to one of their submissions. The  Banks  had  submitted  that  a  term  of  a  contract  that  provided  the  “price  or remuneration” for “goods or services supplied” was absolutely exempt from assessment for  fairness  by  reason  of  Regulation  6(2).  This  was  described  as  the  “excluded  term” construction of the Regulation. Andrew Smith J held that this was not correct.  Regulation 6(2) precluded assessing a price term for fairness by reference to its adequacy as payment  Page 24 \\x0c         for the goods or services provided in exchange. It did not, however, preclude assessing a price  term  for  fairness  according  to  other  criteria.  This  has  been  described  as  the “excluded assessment” construction of the Regulation.  61.  Mr Sumption submitted that the difference between the “excluded term” and the “excluded  assessment”  constructions  was  “a  distraction  from  the  real  issues”.  It  is certainly a distraction from the narrow issue that the parties are now agreed is before the court. But it is only because the “excluded assessment” construction has prevailed that the issue has been narrowed from that in the Agreed Statement of Facts and Issue. Had the “excluded term” construction prevailed, a finding in favour of the Banks that the Relevant Terms  were  included  within  the  meaning  of  the  word  “price”  in  Regulation  6(2)  would have  precluded  any  challenge  to  those  terms  on  the  ground  of  fairness.  As  it  is,  if  the Banks  succeed  on  the  narrow  issue,  this  will  not  close  the  door  on  the  OFT’s investigations  and  may  well  not  resolve  the  myriad  cases  that  are  currently  stayed  in which customers have challenged Relevant Charges. 62. There  is  a  further  general  point  to  be  made.  It  seems  likely  that  many  of  the customers who have challenged Relevant Charges have done so on the basis that they are excessive for the individual services to which they relate. They have treated the Relevant Charges  as  being  levied  in  exchange  for  those  services.  Equally,  one  of  the  provisional grounds of attack advanced by the OFT has been that the Relevant Charges are out of all proportion to the cost of providing the services to which they relate.  The Banks’ primary case is that these attacks are founded on a misconception that the Relevant Charges are payment for the services that trigger them. According to the Banks the reality is that the Relevant  Charges  are  simply  part  of  the  payment  in  exchange  for  a  global  package  of services.  If that is correct, it would seem to follow that the attack based on the disparity between  the  cost  of  providing  the  services  that  trigger  the  Relevant  Charges  and  the amount of the Relevant Charges is based on a false premise and does not in fact involve an  assessment  of  fairness  that  relates  “to  the  adequacy  of  the  price  or  remuneration,  as against the goods or services supplied in exchange”. This was a point that was appreciated by Andrew Smith J. At paragraph 400 of his 63. judgment he says: “Moreover, the basis of the whole package argument is that the Relevant Charges are not the price or remuneration for services but part of the price or remuneration for services. An assessment of the fairness of the Relevant Charges does not  involve  an  assessment  of  the  level  or  adequacy  or appropriateness of the overall price or remuneration for the package  of  services  supplied  by  the  Bank,  and  an assessment  of  the  fairness  of  the  Relevant  Charges  as against those services, apart from being entirely beside the  Page 25 \\x0c         point, would not intrude upon the essential bargain between the  parties  that  the  Directive  and  the  1999  Regulations intend  should  be  protected  from  assessment.  The  whole package  argument  does  not  engage  the  policy  of  the Directive  and  the  1999  Regulations  for  exempting  the fairness of the Relevant Terms from assessment.  Indeed, I am  far  from  convinced  that  an  assessment  of  part  of  the price  or  remuneration  (or  at  least  for  less  than  what  is manifestly the  price  or remuneration) for goods or services would ever be covered by  Regulation  6(2)(b),  but  since  this  is  not  an  argument advanced by the OFT, I say no more about that.” the  predominant  part  of 64.  Mr Crow did not submit before us that if the Relevant Charges formed part of the price paid in exchange for the package of services, they could not be included within the meaning  of  the  word  “price”  in  Regulation  6(2).  I  consider  that  Regulation  6(2)  could apply to a complaint that the Banks’ charges overall, of which the Relevant Charges are an important element, are unfair because those who pay them pay an excessive amount in exchange  for  the  package  of  services  in  respect  of  which  they  constitute  part  of  the payment. Thus the issue of whether or not the Relevant Charges form part of the “price or remuneration, as  against  the goods or  services supplied in exchange” within Regulation 6(2) is not necessarily academic. No attack has yet been made, however, on the level of the Banks’ charges overall.    The reasoning of the Courts below 65. Both Andrew Smith J and the Court of Appeal concluded that the Relevant Terms did not qualify as price or remuneration within the meaning of those words in Regulation 6(2).  66. At  the  heart  of  the  reasoning  of  Andrew  Smith  J  was  the  conclusion  that  the Relevant Charges were not covered by Regulation 6(2) because they were not the “price or  remuneration”  for  “services  supplied  in  exchange”.  They  were  not  charged  “in exchange” for anything. While most of the charges were triggered by the provision of an individual  service  they  were  not  imposed  by  way  of  payment  for  those  services.  They were  charges  levied  because  the  services  in  question  were  supplied  by  the  Banks  “in particular circumstances”. One of the four types of Relevant Charges was not triggered by the provision of a service. Unpaid Item Charges were levied when a request to honour a cheque on an overdrawn account was refused.  Refusing a request could not properly be described as a service at all.  Page 26 \\x0c         Andrew  Smith  J  rejected  the  Banks’  case  that  the  Relevant  Charges  were  part 67. payment  for  the  entire  package  of  services  provided  by  the  Banks  to  current  account customers for the following reasons: “I  am  unable  to  accept  this  argument,  for  two  (linked) reasons.  First, I do not consider that the payments are made in exchange for the whole package of services supplied by the Bank when it is operating a current account. It is not a natural use of language to say that the Relevant Charges are levied or paid in exchange for those services supplied when an account is in credit. Secondly, I do not consider that the payments  are  the  price  or  remuneration  for  those  services in any natural meaning of the phrase or within the meaning of  Regulation  6(2).  The  payments  would  not  be  so recognised by the typical customer when he opens a current account  with  a  Bank,  and  they  are  not  generally  so terms  or  other presented  by documentation.”   the  Banks their in 68. The  Court  of  Appeal  reached  the  same  conclusion  as  Andrew  Smith  J,  but  by  a different  process  of  reasoning.  Lord  Walker  has  set  out  that  reasoning  at  length.  Once again I shall restrict myself to the essence of the Court’s conclusion. In relation to Unpaid Item Charges the Court held that giving consideration to a request to honour a cheque on an overdrawn account was a service, even if the request was turned down. Thus each of the events that triggered a liability to pay Relevant Charges involved the provision of a service. It was not, however, realistic to consider that each Relevant Charge was payment for  the  individual  service  that  occasioned  its  imposition.  Rather,  the  substance  of  the contract had to be analysed as a package.  69. The Court then went on to divide the package into the “core or essential bargain” and  provisions  that  were  “incidental  or  ancillary”,  holding  that  Regulation  6(2)  only applied  to  the  former.  The  core  or  essential  bargain  was  comprised  of  those  matters  to which the typical consumer would have regard when deciding whether to enter into the agreement  with  the  Bank.  The  latter  would  be  those  to  which  he  would  not  attach importance when concluding the contract. The  Court  decided  that  charges  which  were  contingent  upon  the  customer 70. overdrawing  on  his  current  account  would  not  have  been  considered  of  significance  by the typical customer at the time of establishing the account. The charges would only be imposed  in  contingent  circumstances  and  were  akin  to  default  charges  triggered  by  a breach  of  contract,  although  they  were  not  in  fact  triggered  by  a  breach  of  contract because of the manner in which the contractual relationship had been expressly framed. The customer would not consider the contingent liability to pay the Relevant Charges in  Page 27 \\x0c          the  event  of  overdrawing  on  his  account  an  essential  part  of  the  Bank’s  agreement  to provide  these  services  without  charge  provided  that  he  remained  in  credit.    It  followed that the liability to pay the Relevant Charges was not part of the core or essential bargain and did not fall within the ambit of Regulation 6(2). The approach to the issue 71. Early in his argument Mr Sumption said: is…room  for  argument  about  whether the “[T]here insufficient  fund  charges  are  part  of  the  price  for  the package  of  services  or  just  the  particular  service  which occasions their being charged, but we will submit that it is unrealistic  to  say,  as  the  judge  did,  that  insufficient  fund charges  are  not  payable  in  exchange  for  any  service  at  all and are, therefore, not a price at all.” 72. This raises the questions by what criteria do you decide whether the charges are payment  for  services,  if  so,  whether  individual  charges  are  payments  for  individual services  or  part  payment  for  a  package  of  services,  and  from  whose  viewpoint  do  you decide  those  questions?  So  far  as  the  latter  question  is  concerned,  the  choice  would appear  to  be  between  the  viewpoint  of  the  customer,  having  regard  to  the  facts  that  he would reasonably be expected to know, the viewpoint of the Banks, having regard to the more  extensive  knowledge  held  by  the  Banks,  or  no  viewpoint  at  all,  on  the  basis  that these questions have to be answered by application of an objective test to all the material facts. There is an allied question of whether the language used to describe the obligations imposed by the terms is relevant or whether one looks simply at the nature and effect of those obligations. 73. The narrow issue raised by this appeal is only relevant as part of the wider issue that  will  arise  if  and  when  the  Relevant  Terms  are  challenged  as  being  unfair.    At  that point  the  question  may  arise  –  are  the  terms  being  challenged  on  the  ground  that  the Relevant  Charges  are  excessive  having  regard  to  the  services  that  are  provided  in exchange  for  them?  The  court  before  which  the  challenge  is  made  may  then  have  to decide  whether  any,  and  if  so  what,  services  are  provided  in  exchange  for  the  Relevant Charges  as  a  stepping  stone  to  deciding  whether  the  challenge  is  one  precluded  by Regulation  6(2).  To  answer  that  question  the  court  will,  in  my  view,  properly  have  to consider  the  role  played  by  the  Relevant  Charges  having  regard  to  all  the  facts  that  are relevant  to  the  operation  of  the  contractual  adventure  and  not  just  to  those  that  are,  or reasonably should be, within the knowledge of the customer.  Page 28 \\x0c          Conclusions I  wish  to  express  my  admiration  for  the  detailed  and  perceptive  analysis  of 74. Andrew Smith J, although I do not share all the conclusions that he reached. He examined each  of  the  Relevant  Charges  and  the  circumstances  in  which  they  fell  to  be  paid.  He concluded that it was impossible to say that each charge was given in exchange for the event that triggered it. I agree with that conclusion. It accords, of course, with the primary way  in  which  the  Banks  put  their  case.  The  same  conclusion  would,  I  think,  have  been reached  by  a  reasonably  informed  customer  who  applied  his  mind  to  the  question.    In each instance the Judge identified aspects of the provisions for payment of the Relevant Charges  that  would  be  anomalous  if  they  were  intended  to  be  paid  in  exchange  for  the service to which they related. I will take one of the charges made by Barclays to illustrate such  anomalies.  A  ‘Paid  Referral  Fee’  is  charged  when  the  Bank  honours  a  cheque, standing  order  or  direct  debit  in  circumstances  where  the  account  is  overdrawn  without prior arrangement.  The fee is not charged per transaction but at £30 per day. But the fee is only charged on a maximum of three days per month. A customer would not conclude that the fee was charged in exchange for the transaction or transactions concluded on the days when the charges were made but that any other similar transactions in the course of the month were provided free.       75. I agree with Andrew Smith J that a careful analysis of the transactions giving rise to the obligation to pay the Relevant Charges leads to the conclusion that they are not the prices paid in exchange for the transactions in question. I shall revert to the Judge’s rejection of the Banks’ case that the Relevant Charges 76. were  part  of  the  remuneration  paid  for  the  package  of  services  provided  to  holders  of current accounts. First I wish to address the reason why the Court of Appeal rejected that case.  The Court of Appeal accepted that the contract between the Bank and its customer 77. had to be treated as a package. They did not exclude from the package services that were supplied  at  a  time  when  the  current  account  was  overdrawn.  They  accepted  that  the Relevant  Terms  were  terms  that  provided  for  payment  of  price  or  remuneration.  They held, however, that they were not “core” payment terms but “ancillary or incidental price, remuneration  or  payment  terms”  (paragraph  69(iii))  which  did  not  constitute  price  or remuneration that fell within Regulation 6(2). 78. I  can  see  no  justification  for  excluding  from  the  application  of  Regulation  6(2) price  or  remuneration  on  the  ground  that  it  is  “ancillary  or  incidental  price  or remuneration”.  If  it  is  possible  to  identify  such  price  or  remuneration  as  being  paid  in exchange for services, even if the services are fringe or optional extras, Regulation 6(2)  Page 29 \\x0c        will  preclude  an  attack  on  the  price  or  remuneration  in  question  if  it  is  based  on  the contention  that  it  was  excessive  by  comparison  with  the  services  for  which  it  was exchanged. If, on analysis, the charges are not given in exchange for individual services but are part of a package of different ways of charging for a package of varied services, this does not mean that they are not price or remuneration for the purpose of Regulation 6(2). As I observed earlier, an assessment of the fairness of the charges will be precluded if the basis of the attack is that, by reason of their inclusion in the pricing package, those who  pay  them  are  being  charged  an  excessive  amount  in  exchange  for  the  overall package. 79. The Court of Appeal accepted the following argument advanced by the OFT.  The object  of  Regulation  6(2)  is  to  exclude  from  assessment  for  fairness  that  part  of  the bargain that will be the focus of a customer’s attention when entering into a contract, that is to say the goods or services that he wishes to acquire and the price he will have to pay for doing so. Market forces could and should be relied upon to control the fairness of this part of the bargain. Contingencies that the customer does not expect to involve him will not be of concern to him. He will not focus on these when entering into the bargain. The Relevant Charges fall into this category. Free-if-in-credit current accounts are opened by customers  who  expect  to  be  in  credit.  Customers  who  go  into  debit  without  making  a prior  agreement  for  an  overdraft  normally  do  so  because  of  an  unforeseen  contingency.  Customers do not have regard to the consequences of such a contingency when opening a current account.  Accordingly, the Relevant Charges that are then levied do not fall within Regulation 6(2). 80. It  seems  to  me  that  this  reasoning  is  relevant  not  to  the  question  of  whether  the Relevant  Charges  form  part  of  the  price  or  remuneration  for  the  package  of  services provided but to whether the method of pricing is fair. It may be open to question whether it is fair to subsidise some customers by levies on others who experience contingencies that they did not foresee when entering into their contracts. If it is not it may then be open to question whether the Relevant Terms fall within Regulation 5(1). These questions do not, however, bear on the question of whether the Relevant Charges form part of the price or  remuneration  that  is  paid  in  exchange  for  the  services  provided  to  the  holder  of  a current  account.  In  agreement  with  Lord  Walker,  and  for  the  additional  reasons  that  he gives,  I  am  not  persuaded  by  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  reasons  for  excluding  the  Relevant Charges from the “price or remuneration” in Regulation 6(2). 81. I now turn to the reasons given by Andrew Smith J for rejecting the Banks’ case that  the  Relevant  Charges  are  part  of  a  package  of  prices  or  remuneration  paid  for  a package of services – see paragraph 67 above. First he says that it is not a natural use of language  to  say  that  the  Relevant  Charges  are  levied  or  paid  in  exchange  for  those services supplied when an account is in credit. It does not seem to me that this does full credit to the package approach. I do not imagine that there are many customers who run a current  account  that  is  permanently  overdrawn  in  circumstances  where  they  have  not specifically agreed an overdraft facility. Most customers who incur Relevant Charges run current accounts that are in credit most of the time. I do not think that it is an unnatural  Page 30 \\x0c          use of language to say that the Relevant Charges that they pay are paid as part of the price or remuneration provided in exchange for the package of services that they receive.  82. If the Relevant Charges are not part of the price or remuneration for the services provided,  the  question  arises  of  how  the  charges  should  be  classified.  The  answer suggested on behalf of the OFT is that they are in the nature of default payments, imposed not as a hefty element in the price that the Banks hope that  customers will pay for their services  but  by  way  of  sanctions  to  discourage them  from  overdrawing  on  their  current accounts. At paragraph 107 the Court of Appeal held: “[The  Relevant  Charges]  are…akin  to  default  charges which are triggered by a breach of contract.  Although they are not in fact triggered by a breach of contract because of the  manner  in  which  the  contractual  relationship  has  been expressly  framed,  this  does  not  mean  that  they  are  not contingent charges…” 83. Andrew  Smith  J  considered  at  paragraphs  295  to  324  whether  the  Relevant Charges were penalties at common law so as to be unenforceable for that reason. He held that they were not because a penalty at common law is a payment that becomes payable upon  a  breach  of  contract.  Liability  to  pay  Relevant  Charges  is  not  contingent  upon breaches by the customers of their contracts. It is not a breach of any of the standard form contracts under consideration to overdraw, or attempt to overdraw, on a current account. Mr Sumption rightly conceded, however, that the Banks could not convert what were in effect  penalties  into  “price”  simply  by  wording  their  contracts  so  as  to  ensure  that  the contingencies  that  triggered  liability  to  pay  the  charges  did  not  constitute  breaches  of contract. 84.  Mr  Crow  argued  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  was  correct  to  describe  the  Relevant Charges  as  akin  to  default  charges.  They  were  only  payable  in  what  he  described  as “aberrant circumstances”. He pointed out that many of the terms that give the impression that  the  charges  are  the  cost  of  exercising  contractual  options  are  of  recent  origin. Contracts  that  preceded  them  had  terms  which  indicated  that  customers  were  not  to  go into overdraft without prior arrangement, even if doing so was not technically a breach of contract.  He  pointed  out  that  this  is  still  true  of  the  following  current  term  of  the Nationwide Building Society’s terms: “Your  FlexAccount  is  a  share  of  Nationwide  Building Society.  It  will  give  membership  rights  to  the  account holder(s)….Your  membership  may  be  withdrawn  if  you  Page 31 \\x0c        overdraw  without  agreement  or  exceed  an  agreed overdraft.” 85.  Mr  Sumption  challenged  that  submission.  He  submitted  that,  at  a  time  when virtually  the  whole  population  had  a  personal  current  account,  the  ability  to  overdraw informally and at short notice and without elaborate negotiation was an important tool of personal  finance  management.  It  was  an  extremely  valuable  facility,  not  properly  to  be described as an aberration. 86. Andrew Smith J rejected the OFT’s submission that the Banks’ terms that treat an instruction that involves overdrawing as a  request for an overdraft were  misleading.  He held:  “75.    Thus,  apart  from  Nationwide,  the  Banks’  terms  and conditions  are  couched  in  terms  of  the  customer  making  a request  of  the  Bank  and  the  Bank  responding  to  it,  and  in some  cases  they  refer  to  the  Bank  considering  the  request.  The  OFT  criticises  this  terminology  as  an  artificial  device recently  introduced  which  disguises  the  true  nature  of  the parties’  dealings  when  a  customer  gives  his  bank  an instruction which would, if paid, take the account into debit.  Similarly,  the  OFT  suggests  that  the  use  of  the  term ‘overdraft’  to  describe  the  debit  balance  created  in  these circumstances has misleading connotations, and emphasises the  differences  between  the  debit  balance  resulting  from such a payment and an overdraft facility that a bank and a customer might agree should be available on an account.  into relatively their  documentation 76.  Certainly, this terminology has been introduced by the Banks recently. However,  I  am  unable  to  accept  that  the  references  to  the customer making a request for an overdraft when he gives a Relevant  Instruction  are  inappropriate  or  create  a  fiction.  On the contrary, they spell out what is, as a matter of legal analysis, implicitly done when a customer gives a Relevant Instruction.  Of  course,  there  are  differences  between  any resulting  overdraft  and  a  facility  arranged  by  a  specific agreement between a customer and his bank. A facility for an overdraft typically, and as provided by the Banks under their  current  terms  (to  which  I  refer  below),  commits  the bank to allow the customer to overdraw on his account for as long as the facility is in place and within its limits, and, while of course it is possible for a facility to be confined to use for a stipulated purpose, it does not typically cover only a specific payment by the customer. If a fee is charged, it is  Page 32 \\x0c           generally for the facility itself, regardless of whether it is in fact  used  by  the  customer  to  borrow  or  how  much  it  is  so used. (None of the Banks charges a customer for requesting a  facility  in  advance  if  the  request  is  refused.)  However, none  of  this  means  that  it  is  misleading  to  use  the expression  ‘overdraft’  to  refer  either  to  a  facility  or  to borrowing under a facility or to unarranged borrowing. To my  mind  the  expression  is  flexible  enough  naturally  to encompass all these usages.” As Mr Sumption observed there has been no appeal against this finding.  87. In  support  of  his  submissions  Mr  Sumption  relied  upon  the  fact  that  a  very significant  number  of  customers  incur  Relevant  Charges  and  upon  the  overall contribution that these charges make to the revenue earned by the Banks from operating current  accounts.  In  the  region  of  20%  of  customers  incur  Relevant  Charges  but  these account  for  over  30%  of  the  revenue  received  by  the  Banks  from  current  account customers.  This  compares  with  about  50%  that  represents  the  benefit  of  the  use  by  the Banks of the funds in the accounts of customers who are in credit.  88.  When  the  relevant  facts  are  viewed  as  a  whole,  it  seems  clear  that  the  Relevant Charges  are  not  concealed  default  charges  designed  to  discourage  customers  from overdrawing on their  accounts  without prior arrangement.  Whatever  may  have  been  the position in the past, the Banks now rely on the Relevant Charges as an important part of the revenue that they generate from the current account services. If they did not receive the  Relevant  Charges  they  would  not  be  able  profitably  to  provide  current  account services to their customers in credit without making a charge to augment the value of the use of their funds. For these reasons I have formed the conclusion that the Relevant Charges are, as 89. the Banks submit, charges that they require their customers to agree to pay as part of the price or remuneration for the package of services that they agree to supply in exchange.  90.  My  conclusions  accord  with  those  of  Lord  Walker  and,  for  the  reasons  that  he gives as well as my own, I would allow this appeal. 91. I have not found this an easy case and I do not find the resolution of the narrow issue before the court to be acte clair. I agree, however, that it would not be appropriate to refer the issue to the European Court under Article 234. I do not believe any challenge  Page 33 \\x0c            to  the  fairness  of  the  Relevant  Terms  has  been  made  on  the  basis  that  they  cause  the overall package of remuneration paid by those in debit to be excessive having regard to the package of services received in exchange. In these circumstances the basis on which I have answered the narrow issue would seem to render that issue academic. It may be that, if and when the OFT challenges the fairness of the Relevant Terms, issues will be raised that ought to be referred to Luxembourg. That stage has not yet been reached.  LADY HALE For  the  reasons  given  by  Lord  Walker  and  Lord  Mance,  I  too  would  allow  this 92. appeal and make the declaration proposed by Lord Walker. 93. I would only add that, should this or any other Parliament be minded to take up the invitation given in the last paragraph of Lord Walker’s judgment, it may not be easy to find a satisfactory solution. The banks may not be the most popular institutions in the country  at  present,  but  that  does  not  mean  that  their  methods  of  charging  for  retail banking  services  are  necessarily  unfair  when  viewed  as  a  whole.  As  a  very  general proposition, consumer law in this country aims to give the consumer an informed choice rather than to protect the consumer from making an unwise choice. We buy all sorts of products which a sensible person might not buy and some of which are not good value for the money. We do so with our eyes open because we want the product in question more than we want the money. Should financial services be treated differently from other goods and  services?  Or  is  the  real  problem  that  we  do  not  have  a  real  choice  because  the suppliers  all  offer  much  the  same  product  and  do  not  compete  on  some  of  their  terms? This is the situation here. But it is not clear to me whether the proper solution is to find some way of forcing the suppliers to compete with one another in the terms they offer or whether the solution is to condemn one particular model of charging for those services. Fortunately, however, that is for Parliament and not for this Court.            LORD MANCE 94. Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 and The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (S.I. No. 2083), which implement the Directive domestically, both relate to “unfair terms in contracts concluded between a seller or [a] supplier and a consumer”. They make the validity of “a contractual term which has not been individually negotiated” subject generally to the criterion of fairness (defined by reference to whether “contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’  Page 34 \\x0c         rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer”). This appeal concerns the exception to this rule, provided in Article 4(2) of the Directive and Regulation  6(2).  It  is  not  suggested  that  there  is  any  material  difference  between  these two provisions. As Regulation 6(2) puts it: “In  so  far  as  it  is  in  plain  intelligible  language,  the assessment of fairness of a term shall not relate: to  the  definition  of  the  main  subject  matter  of  the (a) contract, or to  the  adequacy  of  the  price  or  remuneration,  as (b) against the goods or services supplied in exchange.” “Adequacy”  (the  word  also  used reasonableness (in amount). in the  Directive)  means  appropriateness  or 95. This  appeal  is  concerned  with  Relevant  Charges  in  the  form  of  unpaid  item charges,  paid  item  charges,  overdraft  excess  charges  and  guaranteed  paid  item  charges levied  when  a  customer  gives  instructions  or  undertakes  a  transaction  without  having sufficient funds to back it. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has written to various banks expressing  concerns  about  the  fairness  of  the  terms  agreed  by  the  banks  with  their customers  so  far  as  they  provide  for  payment  of  Relevant  Charges.  The  question  for decision  is  whether  the  OFT  would  be  entitled  to  challenge  the  fairness  of  such  terms under  regulation  12.  It  is  now  accepted  that  such  terms  are  not  individually  negotiated within regulation 5(1). But it is also common ground (except in the case of four banks in certain  specific  and  minor  respects)  that  they  are  in  “plain  intelligible  language”  within regulation 6(2). The issue is whether the Relevant Charges or the agreement to pay them constitute  “price  or  remuneration”  in  exchange  for  the  supply  of  services  within regulation  6(2).  If  they  do,  then  any  challenge  to  their  fairness  based  on  their appropriateness  in  relation  to  such  services  is  excluded  under  regulation  6(2).  Any assessment based on matters not relating to the appropriateness in amount of the price or remuneration  is  not  excluded  by  regulation  6(2)(b).  This  regulation  is  clearer  than  its predecessor (regulation 3(2) of the 1994 Regulations) which suggested grammatically that it was only a “term which . . . concerns the appropriateness of the price or remuneration” that  was  immune  from  challenge  (language  reflected  in  some  of  the  reasoning  in Director-General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc [2002] 1 AC 481, below).  96. The parties have in their written cases and oral submissions identified two broad issues for determination. The first concerns the proper interpretation of regulation 6(2)(b), the second whether the Relevant Charges fall within the scope of that regulation, properly interpreted.  The  first  issue  is  one  of  European  law.  As  to  the  second,  however,  no question of European law is involved in the determination of the relevant circumstances.  Page 35 \\x0c        The  parties  also  agree  that  no  such  question  is  in  this  case  involved  in  applying  the regulation, properly interpreted, to the circumstances – including identifying the price or remuneration in exchange for which goods or services are to be supplied. European Court of  Justice  authority  for  this  differentiation  appears  to  be  limited  to  the  assessment  of unfairness  under  articles  3  and  4(1)  of  the  Directive  (regulations  5  and  6(1)  of  the Regulations):  Freiburger  Kommunalbauten  GmbH  Baugesellschaft  &  Co.  KG  v  Ludger Hofstetter and Ulrike Hofstetter (Case C-237/02); but I accept its correctness in principle. 97. Since  the  Directive  and  Regulations  are  concerned  with  terms  in  contracts,  it  is first of all necessary to identify the relevant contracts. This is a matter about which the judge, Andrew Smith J, and the Court of Appeal took different views, although again it is not suggested that it raises on the facts of this case any particular issue of European law.  The  banks’  primary  case  is  that  the  relevant  contracts  are  the  contracts  for  an  overall package of banking facilities made by the banks with their customers.  Andrew Smith J rejected  this  analysis  as  unnatural:  payments  by  way  of  Relevant  Charges  could  not  be said  to  be  paid  in  exchange  for  services  supplied  when  an  account  is  in  credit;  and  the description  “free-if-in-credit”  connoted  that  there  was  no  price  to  be  paid  when  an account was in credit (paras. 398-9). Furthermore, if the relevant contract was taken to be the overall package, the Relevant Charges would represent no more than part of the price or remuneration, and an assessment of the fairness of such charges as against the package of  services  would  be  “beside  the  point”  and  “would  not  intrude  upon  the  essential bargain” intended to be protected from assessment (para. 400). 98. There is in my opinion a flaw in this reasoning. It is not comparing like with like.  Viewing the matter at the level of the banking contracts, the comparison is between, on the one hand, the package of services offered by the banks (some or all of which may or may  not  be  used  by  any  particular  customer)  and,  on  the  other,  the  customer’s commitment  to  pay  such  charges  as  may  arise  from  whatever  facilities  he  does  use.  At this  level,  the  banks’  case  is  that  price  or  remuneration  is  or  includes  the  customer’s potential  liability  for  charges,  rather  than  the  payments  which  he  or  she  has  actually  to make if and when such charges are incurred. In my opinion the Court of Appeal was right in para. 97 of its judgment to identify the relevant contract as being in the first instance the banking contract for an overall package of facilities. That is the contract in which the Relevant Charges appear and were agreed.  99. Further,  any  challenge  to  the  fairness  of  a  term  must  be  to  its  fairness  in  the context of the relevant contract in which it appears.  It is “beside the point” if it is not. If, on a proper analysis, the customer’s potential liability for the Relevant Charges is the or part of the “price or remuneration” in exchange for which the overall package of banking services  is  supplied,  and  it  is  challenged  on  the  ground  that  it  makes  such  price  or remuneration disproportionate overall, then regulation 6(2)(b) excludes the challenge. If there is no challenge to the overall proportionality of the overall price or remuneration of the  package,  then  I  fail  to  see  how  a  challenge  to  the  proportionality  of  the  Relevant Charges  in  relation  to  the  cost  of  providing  particular  services  in  isolation  can  be  Page 36 \\x0c        admissible  or  relevant.  A  term  which  is  proportionate  in  context  cannot  become disproportionate viewed out of context.  100. It  is  true  that  Relevant  Charges  are  only  incurred  when  a  customer,  either deliberately or inadvertently, gives an instruction or enters into a transaction, by which as a  matter  of  law  and  contract  he  or  she  requests  the  bank  to  provide  overdraft  facilities.  So, each time such a request is made and acted upon (even if only with the result that the request is declined), it is possible to identify a more developed contractual relationship as arising.  Under  that  relationship,  the  Relevant  Charges  become  payable  in  respect  of  the request  (although  not,  the  judge  thought,  in  exchange  for  any  services  provided  in consequence of the request). I do not however consider that this relationship can be the contract  to  which  the  Directive  and  Regulations  refer.  If  the  agreement  to  incur  the Relevant Charges is part of an overall package contract, its vulnerability to challenge and, if permissible, any assessment of its fairness under the Directive and Regulations must, as I have said, depend upon an analysis of such agreement as part of the package contract. Otherwise, as Mr Sumption pointed out, a customer could challenge each separate part of a  package  in  isolation,  although  as  a  whole  the  price  or  remuneration  charged  was unchallengeable.  101. Issues arise under two heads: the first, the proper interpretation of Article 4(2) and Regulation 6(2) (I shall for convenience generally refer only to the latter); and the second, the application on the facts of whatever is that proper interpretation. As to the first, it is common  ground  that  not  every  provision  for  payment  contained  in  a  contract  for  the supply  of  goods  or  services  is  rendered  immune  from  scrutiny  under  Regulation  6(2). There can be payments which do not constitute either “price or remuneration” of goods or services  supplied  in  exchange.  Further,  payments  which  do  constitute  price  or remuneration in this sense can be challenged as unfair on grounds which do not relate to their  appropriateness  in  amount  as  against  the  goods  or  services  supplied  in  exchange. Heads (d), (e), (f) and (l) in the grey list of terms set out in Schedule 2 to the Regulations fall  within  one  or  both  categories.  Director-General  of  Fair  Trading  v  First  National Bank plc [2002] 1 AC 481 provides another example. 102. In the First National Bank case, the House was concerned with a provision in a regulated credit agreement for interest to continue at the credit agreement rate as against a borrower  who  had  defaulted  and  against  whom  judgment  had  been  entered  for  the principal and interest outstanding to judgment. The County Courts (Interest on Judgment Debts) Order 1991 (SI No 1991/1184) meant that there was no statutory claim for or right to  post-judgment  interest.  Hence,  the  rationale  for  including  a  continuing  interest provision  in  the  credit  agreement.  The  case  arose  under  Regulation  3(2)  of  the  Unfair Terms  in  Consumer  Contracts  Regulations  1994,  which  provided  that  “no  assessment shall be made of the fairness of any term which …. (b) concerns the adequacy of the price or  remuneration,  as  against  the  goods  or  services  sold  or  supplied”.  (This  is  slightly, though  possibly  materially,  different  wording  to  that  of  Regulation  6(2)  of  the  1999 Regulations  which  replaced  it.)  The  House  held  that  Regulation  3(2)  did  not  apply,  but went on to hold the term to have been fair. Passages from the speeches of Lord Bingham  Page 37 \\x0c        of Cornhill (para. 12) and Lord Steyn (para. 34) have been set out by Lord Walker. Both considered  that  clause  8  fell  outside  Regulation  3(2)(b),  as  a  provision  prescribing  the consequences  of  default.    Lord  Bingham  added  in  a  sentence  drawing  on  the  particular wording  of  Regulation  3(2)(b)  that  “It  does  not  concern  the  adequacy  of  the  interest earned  by  the  bank  as  its  remuneration  but  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  bank's entitlement to interest does not come to an end on the entry of judgment”. Lord Hope of Craighead’s explanation is also relevant. He said (para. 43) that: “Condition 8 is a default provision. The last sentence of it is designed to enable interest to be recovered on the whole of the amount due on default. That amount includes legal and other  costs,  charges  and  expenses,  so  it  is  not  confined  to the outstanding balance due by the borrower. I do not think that it can be said to be directly related to the price charged for the loan or to its adequacy. It is concerned instead with the  consequences  of  the  borrower's  breach  of  contract.  It sets out what is to happen if he fails to make the repayments to the bank as they fall due. I agree that regulation 3(2)(b) does  not  apply  to  it,  and  that  its  fairness  as  defined  in regulation 4(1) of the 1994 Regulations must be assessed.” This  underlines  the  distinction  between  payments  due  in  exchange  for  the  original  loan and the financial payments (including those relating to “costs, charges and expenses”) due on  default  under  the  clause.  The  decision  of  Gross  J  in  Bairstow  Eves  London  Central Ltd. v. Smith [2004] EWHC 263 (QB); [2004] 2 EGLR 25 provides another example of the same distinction. 103.  The contracts made by customers for an overall package of banking facilities have been  described  as  on  a  “free-if-in-credit”  basis.  The  OFT  submits  that  this  indicates  or suggests that the agreement to pay Relevant Charges cannot be regarded as the or a part of  the  price  or  remuneration  in  exchange  for  which  banking  facilities  are  supplied.  The banks  submit,  on  the  contrary,  that  the  clear  corollary  of  “free-if-in-credit”  is  that  the services provided will not be free if the customer is not in credit.  They ask rhetorically what  other  price  or  remuneration  there  is,  if  not  the  Relevant  Charges.  The  OFT’s response is that it is conceptually possible to have a contract for services without anything in  exchange  that  counts  in  terms  of  regulation  6(2)(b)  as  either  price  or  remuneration.  That I would accept. The bank might (especially under a basic banking contract which did not allow any overdraft in any circumstances) be content to operate on the basis that its profit would come solely from its power to use money which customers deposited with or arranged  to  have  transferred  to  it.  That  power  follows  from  the  bank’s  ownership  of money deposited with or transferred to it.  (Further, since the deposit with or transfer to a bank of money is the main or part of the main subject matter of a banking contract, any assessment  of  the  fairness  of  it  or  its  legal  consequences  would  appear  to  be  excluded under  regulation  6(2)(a),  rather  than  (b).)  Alternatively,  the  OFT  suggests,  without committing  itself,  that,  if  there  is  any  price  or  remuneration  under  a  free-if-in-credit  Page 38 \\x0c        banking  contract,  it  is  more  easily  found  in  the  customer’s  agreement  to  pay  overdraft interest.   104. In  accordance  with  general  European  legal  principle,  article  4(2)  and  regulation 6(2) are as exceptions to be construed narrowly.  Nevertheless, the concepts of “price or remuneration”  must,  I  think,  be  capable  in  principle  of  covering,  under  a  banking contract,  an  agreement  to  make  a  payment  in  a  particular  event.  The  language  of regulation 6(2)(b) is on its face therefore capable of covering a customer’s commitment, under  the  package  contracts  put  before  the  House,  to  pay  the  Relevant  Charges  in  the specified events. There is no reason why a customer should not be given free services in some circumstances, but, as a quid pro quo, be expected to pay for them in others. 105.  At  various  points  the  submissions  before  the  House  addressed  the  policy underlying the free-if-in-credit system of charging. It is clear from the description free-if-in-credit itself that the system is likely to involve significant elements of cross-subsidy.  Some  customers  (those  remaining  always  or  largely  in  credit)  pay  no  or  few  charges, while others pay charges more regularly.  Overall, around 30% of the banks’ income from their  customers  is  derived  from  the  Relevant  Charges.  According  to  the  OFT’s  own Market  Study  of  July  2008,  77%  of  customers  surveyed  who  had  incurred  a  Relevant Charge  in  the  past  12  months  had  heard  of  such  charges  before  they  incurred  one.  The Relevant Charges levied on any particular customer greatly exceed the actual net cost to the bank of complying with the request(s) impliedly made by the customer leading to the incurring of such charges. But it is obvious on reading the charging structure that charges cannot be directly related to the actual costs of providing any particular service triggering them.  There  are  of  course  other  obvious  elements  of  cross-subsidy,  even  between customers  who  remain  in  credit.  Customers  who  maintain  large  current  accounts  and receive  no  or  limited  interest  on  them  subsidise  in  a  sense  customers  who  manage consistently to keep just in credit. Mr Jonathan Crow QC for the OFT made clear that the OFT  does  not  contend  that  the  element  of  cross-subsidy  provided  by  the  Relevant Charges affects the question whether regulation 6(2)(b) applies. Regulation 6(2)(b) would apply if the banks simply decided to charge more for particular services in order to pay their directors more or to earn more for their shareholders.  It cannot make any difference to its application if the banks decide to adopt a business model which charges more for one type of transaction in order to subsidise another. 106.  The  OFT’s  case,  essentially  accepted  by  the  Court  of  Appeal,  is  that  the agreement to pay the Relevant Charges is not price or remuneration, because regulation 6(2)(b)  is  confined  in  scope  to  payments  in  exchange  for  sales  or  supplies  on  which payments the consumer can be taken to have focused and to which he can be taken truly to have consented. The Court of Appeal encapsulated this conclusion as “import[ing] the notion of essential bargain into the construction of article 4(2) and into both paragraphs (a)  and  (b)  of  regulation  6(2)”  (para.  86).  It  added  that  “the  concept  of  the  essential bargain  flows  naturally”  from  the  structure  and  purpose  of  the  Directive  because  not every  payment  that  a  consumer  makes  falls  within  regulation  6(2)(b),  and  such  a construction “prevents regulation 6(2)(b) being construed too widely”. It considered that  Page 39 \\x0c       its conclusion reflected “the reasoning both in the travaux préparatoires and in the First National  Bank  case”,  which  it  interpreted  as  indicating  that  ancillary  or  incidental payment  terms  were  not  intended  to  be  exempt  from  assessment  for  their  “adequacy” under regulation 6(2) (paras. 64, 69 and 86).  107.  The  considerations  which  the  Court  of  Appeal  saw  as  relevant  to  the  broad  test which it thus identified were as follows (para. 90):    “90.  The  above  analysis  suggests  that  the  following considerations  are  relevant  to  this  broad  question,  together no doubt with many others, depending upon the facts of the particular case:  i)  The  nature  of  the  services  provided  as  a  whole  and  the manner  and term the in  which documentation is provided to consumers.  standard terms ii)  The  quantum  of  the  particular  payment,  the  goods  or services to which it is said to relate and the other payments required under the contract. iii) In order to be 'price or remuneration' within the meaning of article 4(2) the payment provision must not be ancillary to  the  central  bargain  between  the  consumer  and  supplier.  Along this sliding scale: a) if the payment obligations are directly negotiated between the consumer and supplier they will not be the subject Directive; to  assessment  for  fairness  under b)  the  more  closely  related  the  payment  term  is  to the  essential  bargain  between  the  parties,  the  more likely it is to fall within the exception in article 4(2); but c)  the  more  ancillary  the  payment  term  is  and  the less likely it is to come to the direct attention of the consumer at the time the contract is entered into, the less likely it is to be within the concept of 'price or remuneration' within the meaning of the Directive.”  Page 40 \\x0c       108.  One  difficulty  about  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  reasoning  lies  in  its  reliance  on  the concept  of  negotiation  or  indeed  bargain,  as  in  para.  90(iii)(a)  and  (b)  above  –  and elsewhere, repeatedly, in its judgment: see paras.  64, 87, 107 and 109 (negotiation) and 86, 90, 94-95 and 106 (bargain). The Court of Appeal suggested that the absence of any negotiation or bargain or of any ability to negotiate or bargain militated strongly against a conclusion  that  a  particular  charge  constituted  (part  of)  the  price  or  remuneration. However, the Directive and Regulations are only concerned with contractual terms which have  not  been  individually  negotiated.  Another  difficulty  is  that  the  Court  of  Appeal’s broad test, and the sliding scale of relevant considerations introduced by para. 90, convert the apparently simple language of regulation 6(2)(b) (or article 4(2)) into a complex and uncertain  value judgment. This is rendered even more complex by the Court of Appeal’s further conclusion that the judgment should be made by the court through the eyes of “the typical  consumer”  (para.  91).  This  led  to  considerable  argument  before  the  House  as  to who might be regarded as the typical consumer. Was it relevant to look at the whole body of  customers,  or  at  those  who  would  or  might  be  likely  to  incur  Relevant  Charges?  Before the House Mr Crow for the OFT summarised three main considerations on which the OFT relied to determine whether a payment was part of the essential bargain, namely whether  the  payment  was  (a)  ancillary,  (b)  readily  recognisable  or  visible  by  a  typical customer and (c) one arising in the normal performance of the contract.  109.  The  Directive  was  the  result  of  an  iterative  process  between  the  Commission, European  Parliament  and  Council  of  Ministers.  The  outcome  was,  as  not  uncommonly happens, significantly different from that originally proposed. The Commission’s original proposal  of  24  July  1990  (COM(90)  322  fin)  and  its  Explanatory  Memorandum  of  3 September 1990 were drafted with a view to regulating by reference to the test of fairness “every contract between a consumer and a party acting in the course of his trade, business or profession, whether the contract is a “take or leave it” contract, or is in standard form or is negotiated individually”. The proposal was the subject of a critique by Hans Erich Brandner  and  Peter  Ulmer  (The  Community  Directive  on  Unfair  Terms  in  Consumer Contracts:  some  critical  remarks  on  the  proposal  submitted  by  the  EC  Commission, (1991)  28  CMLR  647);  these  authors  argued  that  any  control  by  the  courts  or administrative  authorities  of  the  reasonableness  or  equivalence  of  the  relationship between the price and the goods or services provided was “anathema to the fundamental tenets of a free market economy”, and that the focus should be on improving transparency in  this  area,  the  requirement  of  transparency  being  “directed  against  terms  which  may conceal the principal obligations or the price and thus make it difficult for the consumer to obtain an overview of the market and to make what would (relatively speaking) be the best choice in a given situation” (p.656). 110.  The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens’ Rights of the European Parliament issued  a  report  on  9  April  1991  (A3-0091/91),  which  suggested  the  amendment  of  the proposal  to  exclude  individually  negotiated  contract  terms.  The  Economic  and  Social Committee (consulted by the Council of Ministers) issued its opinion on 24 April 1991, suggesting both that individually negotiated contractual terms required different treatment and  that  an  additional  criterion  of  unfairness  should  be  introduced,  namely  “the  non-transparency  of  a  contract  term”  (OJ  No  C  159,  17.6.1991).  The  European  Parliament  Page 41 \\x0c        repeated its stance that individually negotiated terms should fall outside the proposal, and proposed  that  terms  containing  clauses  “which  are  unreadable  or  likely  to  be misunderstood by consumers because they are not in plain language” should be regarded as unfair (OJ No C 326, 16.12.1991). The Commission on 5 March 1992 responded with an amended proposal (COM(92) 66 fin). This distinguished between the treatment of non-negotiated  and  negotiated  terms,  but  would  have  continued  to  regulate  the  latter  where “imposed upon the consumer” as a result of the seller/supplier’s economic power or the consumer’s economic and/or intellectual weakness. The amended proposal also contained a  requirement  (in  terms  which  become  part  of  the  final  article  5)  that  all  written  terms offered  to  the  consumer  in  writing  “must  always  be  drafted  in  plain,  intelligible language”. 111.  On 22 September 1992 the Council of Ministers adopted its Common Position on the  basis  of  article  100a  of  the  Treaty  (8406/92).  This  restricted  the  proposal  to contractual terms which had not been individually negotiated.  It introduced article 4(2) in its final form and accepted the requirement under article 5 that all written terms offered to the  consumer  in  writing  “must  always  be  drafted  in  plain,  intelligible  language”.  The accompanying  reasons  explained  in  relation  to  article  4  that  “the  new  wording  ….  is intended  to  clarify  the  procedures  for  assessing  the  unfairness  of  terms  and  to  specify their  scope  while  excluding  anything  resulting  directly  from  the  contractual  freedom  of the  parties  (e.g.  quality/price  relationship)”.  The  Parliament  accepted  the  Council’s Common Position on 16 December 1992, and the Directive was finalised on this basis. 112.  The  legislative  history  shows  therefore  an  extensive  process  of  development, during which the original proposal was replaced by an amended proposal which was itself very  largely  amended.  The  measure  ultimately  agreed  was  confined  to  non-negotiated terms. It stressed the need for transparency (“plain, intelligible language”) in relation to all such terms.  But, provided such transparency existed, any assessment of the fairness of such  terms  was  excluded  in  relation  to  “the  definition  of  the  main  subject-matter  of  the contract” and “the adequacy of the price and remuneration …. as against the services or goods supplied in exchange ….”. The general approach and the rationale as explained in the Council’s Reasons match those of Brandner and Ulmer in their article cited above.  It would re-write the legislation to read article 4(2) of the Directive or regulation 6(2) as if they  introduced  as  the  test  a  complex  enquiry  as  to  whether  or  how  far  consumers  had actually exercised contractual freedom when agreeing upon a price or remuneration stated in plain and intelligible language in a contract into which they entered. Article 4(2) and regulation 6(2) can loosely be described as being concerned with the assessment of “core terms” (see e.g. First National Bank). But that is on the basis that price and remuneration always fall within them. The Court of Appeal erred in introducing a yet further restriction, whereby it would be only “essential core terms” which could attract immunity.  113. In my opinion, the identification of the price or remuneration for the purposes of article  4(2)  and  regulation  6(2)  is  a  matter  of  objective  interpretation  for  the  court.  The court should no doubt read and interpret the contract in the usual manner, that is having regard to the view which the hypothetical reasonable person would take of its nature and  Page 42 \\x0c       terms. But there is no basis for requiring it to do so by attempting to identify a “typical consumer”  or  by  confining the focus to matters on which it might conjecture that he or she  would  be  likely  to  focus.  The  consumer’s  protection  under  the  Directive  and Regulations is the requirement of transparency on which both insist. That being present, the consumer is to be assumed to be capable of reading the relevant terms and identifying whatever is objectively the price and remuneration under the contract into which he or she enters. A contract may of course require ancillary payments to be made which are not part of  the  price  or  remuneration  for  goods  or  services  to  be  supplied  under  its  terms.  The First  National  Bank  and  Bairstow  Eves  cases  illustrate  the  distinction  by  reference  to default terms.  114.  Andrew Smith J considered and rejected a submission that the Relevant Charges constituted in reality no more than penalties, disguised (at least in the case of all the terms save those  of Nationwide Building Society) by drafting  which expressed  the charges as arising  in  respect  of  services  to  be  provided  by  the  banks.  He  held  that,  far  from  being inappropriate  or  artificial,  the  language  of  request  reflected  the  true  legal  analysis  of  a situation  where  the  customer  gives  an  instruction  or  enters  into  a  transaction  for  which insufficient  funds  exist  in  his  or  her  account  (paras.  75-76).  There  has  been  no  appeal against that conclusion, and the fact that the relevant contractual arrangement is an overall package contract made between a bank and each customer tends in my view to confirm the  conclusion.  A  customer  making  such  a  contract  accepts  that  the  free-if-in-credit system involves substantial charges if instructions are given or transactions entered into which involve putting the account into debit. While the incurring of Relevant Charges is no  doubt  something  that  customers  would  like  to  avoid,  it  is  a  clearly  explained  and, objectively  viewed,  very  important  feature  of  the  overall  package.  The  OFT’s  case  that such  charges  are  not  “readily  visible”  or  “recognisable”  as  the  price  is  in  my  view untenable.  In so far as it relies on the consideration that the charges are out of proportion to  the  actual  cost  of  rendering  any  services  in  respect  of  an  instruction  or  transaction which would involve an (or an increase in an) unauthorised overdraft, it also presents the paradox,  that  the  higher  the  Relevant  Charges,  the  less  visible  or  recognisable  they  are said to be as the price of the overall package. 115.  Taking  the  view  that  I  do  of  the  meaning  of  both  the  Directive  and  the Regulations,  the  question  arises  whether  it  is  nevertheless  incumbent  on  us  to  refer  the interpretation of the Directive to the Court of Justice. Under CILFIT v Ministry of Health (Case    283/81;  [1982]  ECR  3415)  and  in  the  absence  of  any  prior  Court  of  Justice authority,  this  depends  upon  (a)  whether  the  question  is  relevant  to  the  outcome  of  the case and (b) “whether the correct application of Community law is so obvious as to leave no scope for reasonable doubt”.  In the latter connection we have to ask ourselves whether the answer we consider correct would be equally obvious to the courts of other Member States and to the Court of Justice itself; and in this regard we have to bear in mind the fact that Community legislation is drafted in different languages which may convey different meanings  to  different  readers,  that  the  Community  concepts  it  uses  (here  “price  and remuneration”)  are  autonomous  concepts  and  that  every  provision  of  Community  law must be placed in the context of Community law as a whole. In the present case, we are concerned  with  a  relatively  simple  sentence,  using  simple  and  basic  concepts,  and  the  Page 43 \\x0c       scope for different readings of different language texts seems very limited. The complex and unpredictable value judgment involved in the Court of Appeal’s approach was based in large measure upon a clear error, in treating the existence or absence of negotiation as significant  in  a  context  dealing  by  definition  only  with  non-negotiated  terms.  The suggested test of what is “not . . . ancillary to the main bargain” involves a restatement of the  language  of  the  Directive  and  Regulations;  that  language  treats  the  “price  or remuneration” as axiomatically part of the core bargain and so immune from scrutiny for reasonableness.  Bearing  in  mind  the  general  Community  aim  of  legal  certainty,  the likelihood  of  the  Court  of  Justice  (or  any  other  Member  State’s  courts)  accepting  the Court  of  Appeal’s  approach  to  the  interpretation  of  article  4(2)  seems  to  me  remote indeed.  I would regard the position as acte clair and not as requiring a reference. 116.  However, if one takes a different view on whether the position is acte clair, there remains  the  question  of  relevance.  Eliminating  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  clear  error  in introducing as part of the test whether the relevant term had been “directly negotiated”, and assuming that the Court of Appeal was generally right in adopting as a test whether the term was “not . . . ancillary to the main bargain”, the question would be whether the Court  was  right  to  treat  the  terms  of  the  package  contracts  relating  to  the  Relevant Charges  as  ancillary  terms,  rather  than  as  part  of  the  agreed  price  or  remuneration  in exchange for which the banks undertook to provide their whole package of services. That question  would  involve  the  application  of  the  Directive  and  Regulations,  which  is,  as  I have said, a matter for domestic, not European, law.  The starting point would be that the banks’  customers  committed  themselves,  under  plain,  intelligible  language,  to  pay  the Relevant  Charges  in  respect  of  instructions  given  or  transactions  entered  into  without sufficient funds and in return for the package of services offered by the banks. The Court of Appeal identified a series of considerations, relating to the nature of personal current accounts,  the  contingent  circumstances  in  which  such  instructions  or  transactions  could come  about,  the  uneconomic  nature  (from  the  customers’  viewpoint)  of  the  Relevant Charges  and  the  absence  of  any  marketing  of  the  banks’  services  by  reference  to  such Charges  (para.  99).  It  summarised  the  incurring  of  Relevant  Charges  as  being  “simply outside (or outwith) the ordinary conduct of the contractual relationship” (para. 99(xv)).   117.  Mr Crow repeated and expanded on these points in his case (para. 81) and in his oral submissions before the House; he suggested that, if any price or remuneration could be  identified  at  all,  then  the  bank  interest  charged  on  any  unauthorised  overdraft  was “more  readily  recognisable  as  the  payment  made  in  exchange  for  the  overdraft”  (case, para. 81(r)). But there is no reason why the price or remuneration payable for a package of  services  should  not  consist  of  a  contingent  liability.  The  uneconomic  nature  of  the Relevant  Charges  from  the  customers’  viewpoint  constitutes  the  importance  of  the charges  from  the  banks’  viewpoint,  and  the  plain  intelligible  language  of  the  banking contracts  made  evident  that  there  must  be  a  considerable  element  of  cross-subsidy  in respect of customers while they remained in credit. Like Lord Walker, I would therefore disagree with the Court of Appeal’s application of its test, even had I considered that test to be correct so far as it focused on what was or was not “ancillary” to the main bargain. In  these  circumstances,  it  would  be  unnecessary  to  make  a  reference,  even  if  the  view  Page 44 \\x0c          were  to  be  taken  that  the  meaning  of  price  and  remuneration  in  article  4(2)  of  the Directive is not acte clair. I would therefore allow the appeal and grant the relief proposed by Lord Walker 118. in paragraph 51. I would also endorse Lord Walker’s final paragraph. LORD NEUBERGER I  also  would  allow  this  appeal  for  the  reasons  given  by  Lord  Walker  and  Lord 119. Mance, and would grant the relief proposed by Lord Walker in paragraph 51. 120. I also agree with Lord Phillips, whose reasons are, I think essentially the same as those  of  Lord  Walker  and  Lord  Mance.  On  the  one  issue  on  which  there  may  be  some disagreement,  namely  whether  the  resolution  of  the  dispute  as  to  the  interpretation  of article  4(2)  is  acte  clair,  I  share  Lord  Mance’s  scepticism  as  to  whether  the  Court  of Justice  would  adopt  the  meaning  accepted  by  the  Court  of  Appeal.  However,  like  Lord Phillips,  I  consider  that  it  is  possible  that  the  Court  of  Justice  would  adopt  such  an interpretation,  and  therefore,  if  the  resolution  of  that  issue  were  essential  to  the determination  of  this  appeal,  I  would,  very  reluctantly,  have  concluded  that  a  reference was required. However, as he says, it is unnecessary for the issue to be resolved for the purpose of this appeal – as explained by Lord Walker in para 50, and by Lord Mance in paras 116 and 117.  Page 45\"}, 'press summary': {'Press summary': '25 November 2009  Office of Fair Trading (Respondents) v Abbey National plc & others (Appellants) [2009] UKSC 6 On appeal from the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) [2009] EWCA Civ 116', 'Justices': 'Lord Phillips (President), Lord Walker, Baroness Hale, Lord Mance, Lord Neuberger  INTRODUCTION:  This  appeal  involved  a  relatively  narrow  issue.  The  Supreme  Court  had  to  decide  not  whether  the banks’  charges  for  unauthorised  overdrafts  were  fair  but  whether  the  OFT  could  launch  an investigation into whether they were fair.  At present, banks provide retail banking services on the basis that customers whose accounts are kept in credit (in other words who lend money to the banks) will not be charged for the services provided; customers  who  have  authorised  overdrafts  will  be  charged  interest  on  the  money  that  they  borrow from the bank; and customers who incur unauthorised overdrafts will be charged, not only interest on the sums borrowed, but fixed fees for each particular service involved.   The OFT has power to assess the fairness of  terms in  consumer  contracts  but  this  is  subject  to  the limits  laid  down  in  the  Unfair  Contract  Terms  in  Consumer  Contracts  Regulations  1999,  which implemented  European Council Directive 93/13/EEC.  Regulation 6(2)(b) states that the assessment of the fairness of a term in a contract “shall not relate . . . to the adequacy of the price or remuneration, as against the goods or services supplied in exchange”. In other words, the “value for money” equation is excluded.    The Court of Appeal held that this exclusion applied only to the “core terms” of the contract and not to ancillary terms such as  the charges for unauthorised  overdrafts.  The  Supreme Court  unanimously held that the charges for unauthorised overdrafts fell within this exclusion. They were part of the price paid by the customer for the banking services provided.  However,  the  charges  might  still  be  open  to  assessment  by  the  OFT  on  other  grounds  under Regulation 5.', 'Background to the appeal': ':  The Office of Fair Trading (‘the OFT’) wished to investigate the fairness, under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (‘the Regulations’), of the terms (‘the Relevant Terms’) in the Appellant banks’ contracts with customers imposing charges (‘the Relevant Charges’) on unauthorised overdrafts. The Regulations implemented European Council Directive 93/13/EEC. The OFT applied for a declaration that it was entitled to make such an investigation, notwithstanding Regulation 6 (2) (b) The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.gov.uk  \\x0cof  the  Regulations,  which  stated  that  the  assessment  of  fairness  of  a  term  in  a  contract  ‘shall  not relate…  to  the  adequacy  of  the  price  or  remuneration,  as  against  the  goods  or  services  supplied  in exchange’. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal decided that Regulation 6 (2) (b) did not stop the OFT from making such an investigation. The banks appealed.', 'Judgment': 'The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal by the banks.', 'Reasons for the judgment': '\\uf0b7  Lord Walker made clear that the scope of the appeal was limited – the court did not have the task of deciding whether or not the system of charging current account customers was fair, but whether  the  OFT  could  challenge  the  charges  as  being  excessive  in  relation  to  the  services supplied in exchange (Paragraph 3). As Lord Phillips stated, even if such a challenge was not possible, it might still be open for the OFT to assess the fairness of the charges according to other criteria (Para 61). \\uf0b7  The key issue was whether the charges constituted the ‘price and remuneration’ as against ‘the goods or services supplied in exchange’ within the meaning of the Regulations. The Supreme Court considered and decided a number of arguments as to whether the charges could be said to be ‘price or remuneration’ under Regulation 6 (2) (b): (1)  The  charges  were  not  paid  ‘in  exchange’  for  the  transactions  to  which  they  related  –  eg. honouring a cheque when the customer had insufficient funds to do so (Para 75). (2)  The Court of Appeal was wrong to find that Regulation 6 (2) (b) did not apply to charges that were ‘ancillary’ to the core contract between the bank and customer (Paras 38-41, 47, 78, 112). Lord  Walker  commented  that  Regulation  6  (2)  (b)  contained  no  indication  that  only  the ‘essential’  price  or  remuneration  was  relevant.  In  fact,  any  monetary  price  or  remuneration payable  under  the  contract  would  naturally  fall  within  the  language  of  Regulation    6  (2)  (b) (Para 41). (3)  The  charges  were  not  concealed  default  charges  designed  to  discourage  customers  from becoming overdrawn on their accounts without prior arrangement (Paras 88, 114). The High Court had rejected this argument and was right to do so. (4)  The charges were properly to be regarded as falling within the scope of the Regulations (Paras 43,  80,  104).  They  were  in  fact  part  of  the  price  or  remuneration  paid  by  the  customer  in exchange  for  the  package  of  services  which  made  up  a  current  account  (Paras  47,  89).  The fact  that  liability  to  pay  the  charges  depended  on  specific  events  occurring  was  irrelevant  to that conclusion (Paras 47, 104). \\uf0b7  Accordingly,  since  any  assessment  of  the  fairness  of  the  charges,    which  related  to  their appropriateness as against the services supplied in exchange, fell within Regulation 6 (2) (b), no such assessment could take place and so the appeal would be allowed (Paras 51, 90, 92, 118, 119).  Further Comments \\uf0b7  Lord  Phillips  also  noted  that  in  the  absence  of  the  charges  the  banks  would  not  be  able profitably to provide current account services without a fee (Para 88). He stated that it might be  open  to  question  whether  it  is  fair  to  subsidise  some  customers  whose  accounts  always remain  in  credit  by  levies  on  others  who  experienced  events  they  did  not  foresee  when  they opened their accounts (Para 80). \\uf0b7  Lord Walker commented that ministers and Parliament had decided to transpose the directive as  it  stood  rather  than  to  confer  the  higher  degree  of  consumer  protection  afforded  by  the national  laws  of  some  other  member  states.  Parliament  might  wish  to  consider  whether  to revisit that decision (Para 52). Lord Mance endorsed this comment (Para 118). The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.gov.uk    \\x0c\\uf0b7  Lady Hale commented that if Lord Walker’s invitation to ministers and Parliament was to be taken up, it might not be easy to find a satisfactory solution. She questioned whether the real problem was not the charging model, but the lack of competition between the banks as to the product they offered (Para 93).   No Reference to European Court of Justice \\uf0b7  The  court  decided  that  although  the  interpretation  of  the  European  directive  which  the Regulations  implemented  was  a  question  of  European  law  it  was  not  necessary  to  refer  the matter to the European Court of Justice (Paras 49, 91, 115, 120).

              "'It is now settled law that the standard of proof in care proceedings is the balance of probabilities, as set out in Re and confirmed in Re It is clear from the observations of Lord Hoffman and Lady Hale in Re that the same approach is to be applied to the identification of perpetrators as to any other factual issue in the case. It was incorrect to apply a heightened standard consistent with the gravity of the allegations. There is no obligation for a judge to decide who has caused the harm to the child, as long as that harm is attributable to someone having care of the child, although he should do so if the evidence warrants this. In a split hearing, there may be particular benefits of making such a finding, mainly because it will promote clarity in identifying the future risks to the child and the strategies necessary to protect him from them. Where a specific perpetrator cannot be identified, a judge should still, where possible, identify a pool of possible perpetrators. The test for doing so is the likelihood or real possibility that a particular person was involved. person does not have to prove their innocence to be left out of account- Where a judge has been unable to identify a perpetrator, it is positively unhelpful to have the sort of indication of percentages that the judge gave in this case. If the judge is able to identify a perpetrator on the balance of probabilities, all the evidence accepted by the judge which is relevant to identifying the risks to the child remains relevant to deciding where his The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom Parliament Square London www.supremecourt.gov.uk best interests will lie. The court must also be alive to the possibility that the finding who the perpetrator was is wrong and be prepared to revise it in the light of later evidence. In the circumstances of this case the judge had misdirected herself on the standard of proof in the fact-finding hearing. In those circumstances the case ought to be remitted in whole to a different judge who can decide the matter on the right basis. The decision to remove the second child, who had never been harmed, must also be remitted for rehearing. The judge had held that there was a risk of future harm to him because there was a real possibility that the mother had injured the older child. It was held in Re that this is not the correct approach: predictions of future harm must be based on proven findings of fact. This summary is provided to assist in understanding the Courts decision. It does not form part of the reasons for that decision. The full opinion of the Court is the only authoritative document.
