This  case  is  about  the  proper  approach  to  deciding  who  has  been responsible  for  harming  a  child  in  proceedings  taken  to  protect  that  child,  and others  in  the  family,  from  harm.  It  raises  profound  issues:  on  the  one  hand, children need to be protected from harm; but on the other hand, both they and their families  need  to  be  protected  from  the  injustice  and  potential  damage  to  their whole  futures  done  by  removing  children  from  a  parent  who  is  not,  in  fact, responsible for causing them any harm at all. The facts of this case present us with that dilemma in an unusually stark form.   The facts   3. Because we have decided to allow this appeal and send the case back to be decided  afresh,  we  should  say  only  enough  about  the  facts  to  explain  how  the dilemma arises. We shall use pseudonyms for the two children concerned, one who has  been  harmed  and  one  who  has  not.  Jason  was  born  on  19  May  2007.  On  15 June 2007, when he was just four weeks old, he was found to have bruising on his arms  and  face,  which  the  doctors  immediately  thought  was  caused  non-accidentally  and  not,  as  the  mother  suggested,  by  the  baby  pinching  himself  or sleeping on his dummy. Jason has not lived with his family since then, although he has had frequent and good quality contact with his mother.   4. Jason was living with his mother and father at the time and described by the doctors  as  “thriving”.  Both  parents  said  that  it  was  the  father  who  had  got  up  to attend  to  the  baby  when  he  woke  up  on  the  morning  when  the  bruises  were noticed. The mother took the baby to the clinic that morning and pointed them out to the health visitor. It was not possible to give precise timing for the bruises but it was  not  suggested  that  they  were  old  or of  different  ages.  They  could  have  been inflicted by both parents, but the judge found it more likely that only one of them had inflicted them. The bruises had not been there for so long, nor would they have caused the baby such pain and distress, that the other parent must have known that he was being harmed. This was not, therefore, a case where one parent had failed to  protect  the  child  from  harm  caused  by  the  other.  It  was,  colloquially,  a  pure “whodunit”.   5. The other child is William, born on 12 July 2008, while the proceedings to protect Jason were in train. By then the parents had separated, although they were  Page 2 \\x0c     still  in  touch  with  one  another.  The  father  had  stopped  visiting  Jason,  had withdrawn from co-operation with the social workers and with his solicitors, and played no further part in the proceedings. He has parental responsibility for Jason but not for William. William was removed from his mother shortly after birth and placed with the same foster carer as his brother. He has never been harmed. The case for removing him from his mother rests on the likelihood of his being harmed in the future if he is returned to her.   The law    6. In  this  country  we  take  the  removal  of  children  from  their  families extremely seriously. The Children Act 1989 was passed almost a decade before the Human  Rights  Act  1998,  but  its  provisions  were  informed  by  the  United Kingdom’s obligations under article 8 and article 6 of the European Convention on Human  Rights.  These  affect  both  the  test  and  the  process  for  intervening  in  the family lives of children and their parents.   7. As  to  the  test,  it  is  not  enough  that  the  social  workers,  the  experts  or  the court think that a child would be better off living with another family. That would be social engineering of a kind which is not permitted in a democratic society. The jurisprudence  of  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  requires  that  there  be  a “pressing social need” for intervention and that the intervention be proportionate to that  need.  Before  the  court  can  consider  what  would  be  best  for  the  child, therefore, section 31(2) of the 1989 Act requires that it be satisfied of the so-called “threshold conditions”:   “(a)  that  the  child  concerned  is  suffering,  or  is  likely  to  suffer, significant harm; and  (b) that the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to –   (i) the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were  not  made,  not  being  what  it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect  a parent to give to him; or  (ii) the child’s being beyond parental control.”   8. The leading case on the interpretation of these conditions is the decision of the  House  of  Lords  in  Re  H  (Minors)  (Sexual  Abuse:  Standard  of  Proof)  [1996] AC  563.  Three  propositions  were  established  which  have  not  been  questioned since. First, it is not enough that the court suspects that a child may have suffered  Page 3 \\x0c     significant harm or that there was a real possibility that he did. If the case is based on actual harm, the court must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the child was actually harmed. Second, if the case is based on the likelihood of future harm, the court must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the facts upon which  that  prediction  was  based  did  actually  happen.  It  is  not  enough  that  they may have done so or that there was a real possibility that they did. Third, however, if the case is based on the likelihood of future harm, the court does not have to be satisfied that such harm is more likely than not to happen. It is enough that there is “a  real  possibility,  a  possibility  that  cannot  sensibly  be  ignored  having  regard  to the nature and gravity of the feared harm in the particular case” (per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, at p 585F).   9. Thus the law has drawn a clear distinction between probability as it applies to past facts and probability as it applies to future predictions. Past facts must be proved  to  have  happened  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  is,  that  it  is  more likely  than  not  that  they  did  happen.  Predictions  about  future  facts  need  only  be based  upon  a  degree  of  likelihood  that  they  will  happen  which  is  sufficient  to justify preventive action. This will depend upon the nature and gravity of the harm: a  lesser  degree  of  likelihood  that  the  child  will  be  killed  will  justify  immediate preventive  action  than  the  degree  of  likelihood  that  the  child  will  not  be  sent  to school.    10. The House of Lords was invited to revisit the standard of proof of past facts in  Re  B  (Children)  (Care  Proceedings:  Standard  of  Proof)  [2008]  UKHL  35, [2009]  AC  11,  where  the  judge  had  been  unable  to  decide  whether  the  alleged abuse  had  taken  place.  The  suggestion  that  it  would  be  sufficient  if  there  were  a “real  possibility”  that  the  child  had  been  abused  was  unanimously  rejected.  The House  also  reaffirmed  that  the  standard  of  proof  of  past  facts  was  the  simple balance of probabilities, no more and no less.    11. The  problem  had  arisen,  as  Lord  Hoffmann  explained,  because  of  dicta which  suggested  that  the  standard  of  proof  might  vary  with  the  gravity  of  the misconduct  alleged  or  even  the  seriousness  of  the  consequences  for  the  person concerned  (para  5).  He  pointed  out  that  the  cases  in  which  such  statements  were made  fell  into  three  categories.  In  the  first  were  cases  which  the  law  classed  as civil but in which the criminal standard was appropriate. Into this category came sex  offender  orders  and  anti-social  behaviour  orders:  see  B  v  Chief  Constable  of Avon  and  Somerset  Constabulary  [2001]  1  WLR  340  and  R  (McCann)  v  Crown Court at Manchester [2002] UKHL 39, [2003] 1 AC 787. In the second were cases which  were  not  about  the  standard  of  proof  at  all,  but  about  the  quality  of evidence.  If  an  event  is  inherently  improbable,  it  may  take  better  evidence  to persuade the judge that it has happened than would be required if the event were a commonplace.  This  was  what  Lord  Nicholls  was  discussing  in  Re  H  (Minors),  Page 4 \\x0c     above, at p 586. Yet, despite the care that Lord Nicholls had taken to explain that having regard to the inherent probabilities did not mean that the standard of proof was  higher,  others  had  referred  to  a  “heightened  standard  of  proof”  where  the allegations were serious. In the third category, therefore, were cases in which the judges were simply confused about whether they were talking about the standard of  proof  or  the  role  of  inherent  probabilities  in  deciding  whether  it  had  been discharged. Apart from cases in the first category, therefore, “the time has come to say, once and for all, that there is only one civil standard of proof and that is proof that that the fact in issue more probably occurred than not” (para 13).   12. This  did,  of  course,  leave  a  role  for  inherent  probabilities  in  considering whether  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  an  event  had  taken  place.  But,  as  Lord Hoffmann  went  on  to  point  out  at  para  15,  there  was  no  necessary  connection between seriousness and inherent probability:   “It  would  be  absurd  to  suggest  that  the  tribunal  must  in  all  cases assume  that  serious  conduct  is  unlikely  to  have  occurred.  In  many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people,  it  would  make  no  sense  to  start  one’s  reasoning  by  saying that  assaulting  children  is  a  serious  matter  and  therefore  neither  of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the  question  for  the  tribunal  is  simply  whether  it  is  more  probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator.”   Lady Hale made the same point, at para 73:   “It may be unlikely that any person looking after a baby would take him  by  the  wrist  and  swing  him  against  the  wall,  causing  multiple fractures and other injuries. But once the evidence is clear that that is indeed  what  has  happened  to  the  child,  it  ceases  to  be  improbable. Someone looking after the child at the relevant time must have done it.  The  inherent  improbability  of  the  event  has  no  relevance  to deciding  who  that  was.  The  simple  balance  of  probabilities  test should be applied.”   13.  None  of  the  parties  in  this  case  has  invited  the  Supreme  Court  to  depart from those observations, nor have they supported the comment made in the Court of Appeal that Re B “was a ‘sweeping departure’ from the earlier authorities in the House  of  Lords  in  relation  to  child  abuse,  most  obviously  the  case  of  Re  H” ([2009]  EWCA  Civ  1048,  para  14).  All  are  agreed  that  Re  B  reaffirmed  the  Page 5 \\x0c     principles  adopted  in  Re  H  while  rejecting  the  nostrum,  “the  more  serious  the allegation, the more cogent the evidence needed to prove it”, which had become a commonplace but was a misinterpretation of what Lord Nicholls had in fact said.   14. Re B was not a new departure in any context. Lord Hoffmann was merely repeating  with  emphasis  what  he  had  said  in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home Department  v  Rehman  [2001]  UKHL  47,  [2003]  1  AC  153,  at  para  55.  A differently  constituted  House  of  Lords  applied  the  same  approach  in  Re  D (Secretary  of  State  for  Northern  Ireland  intervening)  [2008]  UKHL  33,  [2008]  1 WLR 1499.   15. In Re B, the House also declined an invitation to overrule the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re M and R (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Expert Evidence) [1996] 4 All ER 239. This was concerned with the stage after the court is satisfied that the threshold  has  been  crossed.  The  court  has  then  to  decide  what  order,  if  any,  to make. The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration: 1989 Act, s 1(1). In deciding whether or not to make a care or supervision order, the court must have regard  in  particular  to  the  so-called  “checklist”  of  factors:  1989  Act,  s  1(3),  (4). These include “(e) any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering”.   16. In Re M and R, the Court of Appeal determined that section 1(3)(e) should be interpreted in the same way as section 31(2)(a). The court must reach a decision based on facts, not on suspicion or doubts. Butler-Sloss LJ said this:   “[Counsel’s] point was that if there is a real possibility of harm in the past,  then  it  must  follow  (if  nothing  is  done)  that  there  is  a  risk  of harm in the future. To our minds, however, this proposition contains a non sequitur. The fact that there might have been harm in the past does not establish the risk of harm in the future. The very highest it can  be  put  is  that  what  might  possibly  have  happened  in  the  past means that there may possibly be a risk of the same thing happening in  the  future.  Section  1(3)(e),  however,  does  not  deal  with  what might possibly have happened or what future risk there may possibly be.  It  speaks  in  terms  of  what  has  happened  or  what  is  at  risk  of happening.  Thus,  what  the  court  must  do  (when  the  matter  is  in issue) is to decide whether the evidence establishes harm or the risk of harm.”   17. In agreeing with this approach in Re B, at para 56, Lady Hale commented that in such a case, “as indicated by Butler-Sloss LJ …, the ‘risk’ is not an actual risk to the child but a risk that the judge has got it wrong. We are all fallible human  Page 6 \\x0c     beings, very capable of getting things wrong. But until it has been shown that we have, it has not been shown that the child is in fact at any risk at all”. Re M and R was  also  approved  by  Lord  Nicholls  in  Re  O  and  another  (Minors)  (Care: Preliminary  Hearing)  [2003]  UKHL  18,  [2004]  1  AC  523,  a  case  to  which  we shall return.    18. The  House  in  Re  B  also  recognised  that  courts  and  local  authorities  have different roles to play in protecting children from harm. It is worth re-emphasising this,  given  the  understandable  concerns  in  the  wake  of  the  “Baby  P”  case  that social  workers  and  other  professionals  were  not  being  sufficiently  active  in  their protective  role,  and  the  resulting  increase  in  the  numbers  of  care  proceedings. Social workers are the detectives. They amass a great deal of information about a child  and  his  family.  They  assess  risk  factors.  They  devise  plans.  They  put  the evidence which they have assembled before a court and ask for an order.   19.  Article  6  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  requires  that  “In the determination of his civil rights and obligations, . . . everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law”. The court subjects the evidence of the local authority to  critical  scrutiny,  finds  what  the  facts  are,  makes  predictions  based  upon  the facts, and balances a range of considerations in deciding what will be best for the child. We should no more expect every case which a local authority brings to court to result in an order than we should expect every prosecution brought by the CPS to result in a conviction. The standard of proof may be different, but the roles of the social workers and the prosecutors are similar. They bring to court those cases where there is a good case to answer. It is for the court to decide whether the case is made out. If every child protection case were to result in an order, it would mean either  that  local  authorities  were  not  bringing  enough  cases  to  court  or  that  the courts were not subjecting those cases to a sufficiently rigorous scrutiny.    The “whodunit” problem   20. So far the position is plain. But the threshold criteria do not in terms require that the person whose parental responsibility for the child is to be interfered with or even taken away by the order be responsible for the harm which the child has suffered  or  is  likely  to  suffer  in  the  future.  It  requires  simply  that  “the  harm,  or likelihood of harm, is attributable to … the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect  a  parent  to  give  to  him”.  Clearly,  the  object  is  to  limit  intervention  to certain kinds of harm – harm which should not happen if a child is being looked after  properly.  But  is  it  also  intended  to  limit  intervention  to  cases  where  the  Page 7 \\x0c     person  whose  rights  are  to  be  interfered  with  bears  some  responsibility  for  the harm?   21. It cannot have been intended that a parent whose child has been harmed as a result of a lack of proper care in a hospital or at school should be at risk of losing her  child.  The  problem  could  be  approached  through  the  welfare  test,  because removal  from  home  would  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of  such  a  child.  However, because  of  the  risk  of  social  engineering,  the  threshold  criteria  were  meant  to screen  out  those  cases  where  the  family  should  not  be  put  at  any  risk  of intervention.  Hence  attention  has  focussed  on  the  attributability  criterion.  In  the case  confusingly  reported  in  the  Law  Reports  as Lancashire  County  Council  v  B [2000]  2  AC  147,  but  in  the  All  England  Law  Reports  as  Lancashire  County Council v A [2000] 2 All ER 97, the House of Lords considered what is meant by “the care given to the child”. Does it mean only the care given by the parents or primary carers or does it mean the care given by anyone who plays a part in the child’s  care?  Lord  Nicholls,  with  whom  Lord  Slynn,  Lord  Nolan  and  Lord Hoffmann agreed, found that it referred primarily to the former. But if, as in that case, the care of the child was shared between two households and the judge could not decide which was responsible for the harm suffered by the child, the phrase “is apt to embrace not merely the care given by the parents or other primary carers; it is  apt  to  embrace  the  care  given  by  any  of  the  carers”  (p  166).  Thus  the  criteria were  satisfied  in  respect  of  a  child,  A,  who  had  been  injured,  even  though  this might  have  been  attributable  to  the  care  she  had  received  from  her  childminder rather than from her parents.    22.   Lord Clyde put the test in this helpful way, at p 169C, with the same result:  “That  the  harm  must  be  attributable  to  the  care  given  to  the  child requires that the harm must be attributable to the acts or omissions of someone  who  has  the  care  of  the  child  and  the  acts  or  omissions must occur in the course of the exercise of that care. To have the care of a child comprises more than being in a position where a duty of care towards the child may exist. It involves the undertaking of the task of looking after the child.”     23.  However, it is worth noting that the Court of Appeal had confirmed that the criteria were not satisfied in respect of the childminder’s child, B, because he had not been harmed at all. The only basis for suggesting that there was any likelihood of harm to him was the possibility that his mother had harmed the other child and that had not been proved: Re H applied. The local authority did not appeal against this.       Page 8 \\x0c       25.   24. Re O and another (Minors)(Care: Preliminary Hearing) [2003] UKHL 18, [2004] 1 AC 523 was concerned with the more common problem, where the child has  been  harmed  at  the  hands  of  one  of  his  parents  but  the  court  cannot  decide which. The attributability condition was satisfied. Furthermore, when considering the  welfare  test,  the  court  had  to  proceed  on  the  basis  that  the  child  was  at  risk. Lord Nicholls, with whom all other members of the Committee agreed, said this, at para 27:    “Quite simply, it would be grotesque if such a case had to proceed at the  welfare  stage  on  the  footing  that,  because  neither  parent, considered  individually,  has  been  proved  to  be  the  perpetrator, therefore the child is not at risk from either of them. This would be grotesque  because  it  would  mean  the  court  would  proceed  on  the footing that neither parent represents a risk even though one or other of them was the perpetrator of the harm in question.”    Lord  Nicholls  went  on,  at  para  32,  to  give  the  following  guidance,  on  the assumption  that  the  hearing  would  be  split  into  a  “fact-finding”  and  a  “disposal” stage and that each might be heard by a different judge:   “.  .  .  the  judge  at  the  disposal  hearing  will  take  into  account  any views  expressed  by  the  judge  at  the  preliminary  hearing  on  the likelihood  that  one  carer  was  or  was  not  the  perpetrator,  or  a perpetrator,  of the circumstances, these views may be of considerable value in deciding the outcome of the application: for instance, whether the child should be rehabilitated with his mother.”  injuries.  Depending  on inflicted the In Re B, Lady Hale commented as follows at para 61: “The decisions in In re H, Lancashire County Council v B [2000] 2 AC  147,  and  In  re  O [2004]  1  AC  523  fit  together  as  a  coherent whole. The court must first be satisfied that the harm or likelihood of harm  exists.  Once  that  is  established,  .  .  .  ,the  court  has  to  decide what  outcome  will  be  best  for  the  child.  It  is  very  much  easier  to decide  upon  a  solution  if  the  relative  responsibility  of  the  child’s carers for the harm which she or another child has suffered can also be  established.  But  the  court  cannot  shut  its  eyes  to  the  undoubted harm which has been suffered simply because it does not know who was  responsible.  The  real  answers  to  the  dilemma  posed  by  those cases  lie  elsewhere  –  first,  in  a  proper  approach  to  the  standard  of  Page 9 \\x0c      proof,  and  second,  in  ensuring  that  the  same  judge  hears  the  whole case. Split hearings are one thing; split judging is quite another.”   26.  We are told that practice has now changed and that, barring accidents, the same  judge  does  conduct  both  parts  of  a  split  hearing.  Nevertheless,  the  main object of splitting the hearing is to enable facts to be found. If the threshold is not crossed, the case can be dismissed at that stage. If it is crossed, the professionals can  base  both  their  assessments  and  their  further  work  with  the  family  upon  the facts found. It is not at all uncommon for parents to become much more open with the professionals when faced with the judge’s clear findings based upon what the evidence shows. Hence there should always be a judgment to explain his findings at that stage.   These proceedings   27. It was necessary to give the above account of the development of the law in order to understand what happened in these proceedings. The case was originally identified as suitable for a split hearing; then it was decided to hold a composite hearing; but for regrettable practical reasons, the hearing was split once more. By that stage, the father was playing no part, but for some unknown reason the local authority decided not to issue a witness summons to require his attendance. That is regrettable  because  the  judge  might  well  have  found  it  easier  to  make  clear findings had he given evidence. The mother played a full part in the proceedings and  in  the  assessments,  but  only  accepted  that  the  bruises  were  non-accidentally caused after the possibility of a blood disorder had effectively been ruled out.   28. The judge heard evidence over three days in January 2008 and three further days in March. She handed down a detailed judgment in note form on 3 April. This was before the House of Lords’ decision in Re B. At the outset, under the heading ‘Test’, she directed herself as follows:   “The test I have applied in relation to these findings is that set out in the House of Lords case of [Re H] of 1996. The standard of proof I apply is on the balance of probability. The allegations in this case are very  serious  indeed  and  in  many  respects  are  also  very  unusual. When I apply the appropriate standard of proof, it has to be based on evidence  of  reliability  and  cogency  equivalent  to  the  gravity  of  the allegations.”   Page 10 \\x0c     29. She then listed five questions, three of which are relevant to the issue before this  Court:  first,  whether  the  child  had  suffered  non-accidental  injury;  second whether  the  perpetrator  could  be  identified;  and  third  “even  if  the  perpetrator cannot  be  identified,  can  either  of  the  parents  be  excluded  as  a  perpetrator?” However,  having  concluded  that  the  injuries  were  non-accidental,  she  did  not  in terms ask herself whether she could identify the perpetrator. She simply listed the various  factors  which  she  took  into  account  in  relation  to  each  parent.  She indicated at the outset of her list relating to the father that “there is a high index of suspicion  in  relation  to  the  father”  and  concluded  that  he  could  not  be  ruled  out. There was no such index in relation to the mother but for a variety of reasons the judge also concluded that the mother could not be ruled out.    30. The final hearing was listed for 5 June but could not proceed. As suggested in  Re  O,  the  judge  was  invited  to  give  an  indication  of  the  relative  likelihood  of father  or  mother  being  responsible  for  the  injuries,  in  order  to  assist  with  the assessment process. In oral exchanges she indicated that it was more likely that the father was the perpetrator than the mother. In a written “Adjunct to Judgment” she explained  that  “Invidious  though  it  is  to  be  too  specific,  but  to  help  further assessments, I am prepared to say that I feel it 60% likely that the father injured the child and 40% likely that it was the mother.”   31. The final hearing eventually took place before the same judge in December 2008 with judgment in January 2009. Part of the reason for the delay was that the mother had been unwell following the birth of her second child, William, in July. At the final hearing, the judge was invited to revisit her findings in the light of Re B,  in  which  judgment  was  given  on  11  June  2008.  She  declined  to  say  that  her finding meant that the father was the perpetrator of the injuries. She observed that:   “When  one  is  deciding  these  issues,  a  judge  frequently  reluctantly comes  to  the  conclusion  that  he  cannot  decide  who  is  to  blame between two parents or among more than two people who have had care of the child over the relevant period. However, although unable to  form  a  definitive  decision  to  the  requisite  standard,  a  judge  can still have an impression, falling short of a finding, that the propensity of the parties and the surrounding circumstances make it more likely that it was one party than another.”   Hence  the  mother  was  not  “absolved  as  a  really  possible  or  likely  perpetrator”. This meant that the threshold was crossed, not only in relation to the child who had suffered harm, but also in relation to the child who had not. The fact that there was a real possibility that she had caused the injuries to Jason meant that there was a real possibility that she would injure William.  Page 11 \\x0c     32.  After  considering  the  welfare  factors  she  concluded  that  the  mother’s vulnerable personality was such that she would need therapy in order to make the necessary  changes  so  that  she  could  provide  a  safe  and  stable  upbringing  for  the children.  Their  lives  could  not  be  put  on  hold  in  the  meantime.  Hence  the  judge approved  the  care  plan  to  place  them  both  for  adoption  and  made  care  and placement  orders  in  respect  of  both  children.  She  did,  however,  give  the  mother permission to appeal but this was not included in the original order drawn up by the court.   33. Lord  Justice  Wall  also  gave  permission  to  appeal,  observing  that  the  case “provides a useful opportunity for the Court of Appeal to resolve a point which has arisen  following  the  decision  of  the  House  of  Lords  in  Re  B,  namely  (1)  if  only parents  are  ‘in  the  frame’  for  having  injured  a  child  but  (2)  the  judge  cannot  as between  parents  identify  the  perpetrator  of  the  injuries,  can  that  judge  (3) apportion  likely  responsibility  between  them?”  Before  the  Court  of  Appeal, however, this was not the main issue. It was argued that, following Re B, the test for identifying the perpetrator was the balance of probabilities and that the effect of the “Adjunct to judgment” was that this judge had in fact identified the father. The appeal was dismissed: [2009] EWCA Civ 1048.   Identifying the perpetrator: the standard of proof   34. The first question listed in the statement of facts and issues is whether it is now settled law that the test to be applied to the identification of perpetrators is the balance  of  probabilities.  The  parties  are  agreed  that  it  is  and  they  are  right.  It  is correct,  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  observed,  that  Re  B  was  not  directly  concerned with the identification of perpetrators but with whether the child had been harmed. However, the observations of Lord Hoffmann and Lady Hale, quoted at paragraph 12 above, make it clear that the same approach is to be applied to the identification of  perpetrators  as  to  any  other  factual  issue  in  the  case.  This  issue  shows  quite clearly  that  there  is  no  necessary  connection  between  the  seriousness  of  an allegation and the improbability that it has taken place. The test is the balance of probabilities, nothing more and nothing less.       35.  Of course, it may be difficult for the judge to decide, even on the balance of probabilities, who has caused the harm to the child. There is no obligation to do so. As we have already seen, unlike a finding of harm, it is not a necessary ingredient of the threshold criteria. As Lord Justice Wall put it in Re D (Care Proceedings: Preliminary  Hearings)  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  472,  [2009]  2  FLR  668,  at  para  12, judges should not strain to identify the perpetrator as a result of the decision in Re B:   Page 12 \\x0c      “If  an  individual  perpetrator  can  be  properly  identified  on  the balance of probabilities, then . . . it is the judge’s duty to identify him or  her.  But  the  judge  should  not  start  from  the  premise  that  it  will only  be  in  an  exceptional  case  that  it  will  not  be  possible  to  make such an identification.”    36. There  are  particular  benefits  in  making  such  a  finding  in  this  context, especially where there is a split hearing. Miss Frances Judd QC, on behalf of the children’s guardian in this case, has stressed that the guardian would rather have a finding  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  than  no  finding  at  all.  There  are  many reasons for this. The main reason is that it will promote clarity in identifying the future risks to the child and the strategies necessary to protect him from them. For example, a different care plan may be indicated if there is a risk that the parent in question will ill-treat or abuse the child from the plan that may be indicated if there is a risk that she will be vulnerable to relationships with men who may ill-treat or abuse the child.   37.  Another  important  reason  is  that  it  will  enable  the  professionals  to  work with  the  parent  and  other  members  of  the  family  on  the  basis  of  the  judge’s findings.  As  the  Court  of  Appeal  said  in  Re  K  (Non-Accidental  Injuries: Perpetrator: New Evidence) [2004] EWCA Civ 1181, [2005] 1 FLR 285, at para 55:   “It  is  paradigmatic  of  such  cases  that  the  perpetrator  denies responsibility and that those close to or emotionally engaged with the perpetrator  likewise  deny  any  knowledge  of  how  the  injuries occurred. Any process, which encourages or facilitates frankness, is, accordingly, in our view, to be welcomed in principle.”   Often,  it  is  not  only  the  parents,  but  the  grandparents  and  other  members  of  the family, who may be the best resource to protect the child in the future but who are understandably reluctant to accept that someone close to them could be responsible for  injuring  a  child.  Once  that  fact  is  brought  home  to  them  by  a  clear  finding based upon the evidence, they may be able to work with the professionals to keep the child within the family.   38. the child, whatever the outcome of the proceedings:   Re K also suggested, at para 56, that there would be long term benefits for  Page 13 \\x0c     “.  .  .  we  are  also  of  the  view  that  it  is  in  the  public  interest  that children  have  the  right,  as  they  grow  into  adulthood,  to  know  the truth  about  who  injured  them  when  they  were  children,  and  why. Children  who  are  removed  from  their  parents  as  a  result  of  non-accidental injuries have in due course to come to terms with the fact that one or both of their parents injured them. This is a heavy burden for any child to bear. In principle, children need to know the truth if the truth can be ascertained.”   If the judge cannot identify a perpetrator?   39. The  second  and  third  questions  in  the  statement  of  facts  and  issues  ask whether  judges  should  refrain  from  seeking  to  identify  perpetrators  at  all  if  they are  unable  to  do  so  on  the  civil  standard  and  whether  they  should  now  be discouraged  from  expressing  a  view  on  the  comparative  likelihood  as  between possible perpetrators. These appear to be linked but they are distinct.   40.  As to the second, if the judge cannot identify a perpetrator or perpetrators, it is still important to identify the pool of possible perpetrators. Sometimes this will be necessary in order to fulfil the “attributability” criterion. If the harm has been caused  by  someone  outside  the  home  or  family,  for  example  at  school  or  in hospital  or  by  a  stranger,  then  it  is  not  attributable  to  the  parental  care  unless  it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it. Sometimes it will desirable for the same reasons as those given above. It will help to identify the real  risks  to  the  child  and  the  steps  needed  to  protect  him.  It  will  help  the professionals in working with the family. And it will be of value to the child in the long run.    41. In North Yorkshire County Council v SA [2003] EWCA Civ 839, [2003] 2 FLR  849,  the  child  had  suffered  non-accidental  injury  on  two  occasions.  Four people  had  looked  after  the  child  during  the  relevant  time  for  the  more  recent injury  and  a  large  number  of  people  might  have  been  responsible  for  the  older injury.  The  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  the  judge  had  been  wrong  to  apply  a  “no possibility”  test  when  identifying  the  pool  of  possible  perpetrators.  This  was  far too  wide.  Dame  Elizabeth  Butler-Sloss  P,  at  para  26,  preferred  a  test  of  a “likelihood or real possibility”.   42.  Miss  Susan  Grocott  QC,  for  the  local  authority,  has  suggested  that  this  is where confusion has crept in, because in Re H this test was adopted in relation to the  prediction  of  the  likelihood  of  future  harm  for  the  purpose  of  the  threshold criteria. It was not intended as a test for identification of possible perpetrators.   Page 14 \\x0c     43. That may be so, but there are real advantages in adopting this approach. The cases are littered with references to a “finding of exculpation” or to “ruling out” a particular  person  as  responsible  for  the  harm  suffered.  This  is,  as  the  President indicated, to set the bar far too high. It suggests that parents and other carers are expected to prove their innocence beyond reasonable doubt. If the evidence is not such  as  to  establish  responsibility  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  it  should nevertheless  be  such  as  to  establish  whether  there  is  a  real  possibility  that  a particular person was involved. When looking at how best to protect the child and provide  for  his  future,  the  judge  will  have  to  consider  the  strength  of  that possibility as part of the overall circumstances of the case.    44.  As to the third question, times have changed since Re O. Barring unforeseen accidents,  the  same  judge  will  preside  over  both  parts  of  the  hearing.  While  it  is helpful  to  have  a  finding  as  to  who  caused  the  injuries  if  such  a  finding  can  be made,  the  guardian’s  view  is  that  it  is  positively  unhelpful  to  have  the  sort  of indication  of  percentages  that  the  judge  was  invited  to  give  in  this  case.  Lord Justice Thorpe suggested, [2009] EWCA Civ 1048, para 17, that judges should be cautious about amplifying a judgment in which they have been unable to identify a perpetrator: “better to leave it thus”. We agree.   The unasked question   45. If the judge can identify a perpetrator on the balance of probabilities, what is to be done about the risk that he may be wrong and that some-one else was in fact responsible? We are indeed all fallible human beings. We can make mistakes, however hard we try to pay careful attention to the quality of the evidence before us and reach findings which are rationally based upon it.    46.  However, once the court has identified a perpetrator, the risk is not a proven risk to the child but a risk that the judge has got it wrong. Logically and sensibly, although the judge cannot discount that risk while continuing to hear the case, he cannot  use  it  to  conclude  that  there  is  a  proven  risk  to  the  child.  But  all  the evidence (if accepted by the judge) relating to all the risk factors that the judge has identified remains relevant in deciding what will be best for the child. And he must remain  alive  to  the  possibility  of  mistake  and  be  prepared  to  think  again  if evidence emerges which casts new light on  the  evidence  which  led  to  the  earlier findings. It is now well settled that a judge in care proceedings is entitled to revisit an earlier identification of the perpetrator if fresh evidence warrants this (and this Court  saw  an  example  of  this  in  the  recent  case  of  Re  I  (A  Child)  [2009]  UKSC 10).  The  guardian  also  submits  that  the  professionals  will  find  it  easier  to  work with this approach.        Page 15 \\x0c     47. It  is  important  not  to  exaggerate  the  extent  of the  problem.  It  only  really arises in split hearings, which were not originally envisaged when the Children Act was passed. In a single hearing the judge will know what findings of fact have to be  made  to  support  his  conclusions  both  as  to  the  threshold  and  as  to  the  future welfare of the child. Moreover, cases rarely come as neatly packaged as this one does.  In  most  cases,  the  injuries  are  such  that,  even  if  one  parent  was  not responsible  for  causing  them,  she  was  undoubtedly  responsible  for  failing  to protect  the  child  from  the  person  who  did  cause  them.  In  many  cases,  there  are other risks to the child besides the risk of physical injury. The evidence which is relevant to identifying the perpetrator will also be relevant to identifying the other risks  to  the  child  and  to  assessing  what  will  be  best  for  him  in  the  future.  But clearly  the  steps  needed  to  protect  against  some  risks  will  be  different  from  the steps needed to protect against others. And the overall calculus of what will be best for the child in the future will be affected by the nature and extent of the identified risks. There are many, many factors bearing upon the child’s best interests and the identification of risks is only one of them.    The conclusion in this case   48.  We have every sympathy for the judge, who was only repeating the mantra which many other judges at every level had repeated in the past. But it is clear that she  did  misdirect  herself  on  the  standard  of  proof  at  the  fact-finding  hearing. Because she later said that she had simply been unable to decide, we do not think that  we  can  accept  the  invitation  of  Mr  Anthony  Hayden  QC,  on  behalf  of  the mother,  to  treat  her  “Adjunct  to  judgment”  as  a  finding  that  the  father  was  the perpetrator. That was not what she thought she was doing. However, that was an ex post facto rationalisation on her part. We cannot know what finding she would have made had she directed herself correctly in the first place. It is only right, for the sake of these children and their mother, that they should have the whole case put before a different judge who can decide the matter on the right basis.   49. There  is  a  further  reason  to  remit  the  case.  The  judge  found  the  threshold crossed in relation to William on the basis that there was a real possibility that the mother had injured Jason. That, as already explained, is not a permissible approach to a finding of likelihood of future harm. It was established in Re H and confirmed in Re O, that a prediction of future harm has to be based upon findings of actual fact  made  on  the  balance  of  probabilities.  It  is  only  once  those  facts  have  been found that the degree of likelihood of future events becomes the “real possibility” test  adopted  in  Re  H.  It  might  have  been  open  to  the  judge  to  find  the  threshold crossed in relation to William on a different basis, but she did not do so.     Page 16 \\x0c50. The case may look very different now that the mother’s life has moved on and in the mean time, thankfully, the children have been well protected from harm. The  appeal  is  therefore  allowed  and  the  case  remitted  for  a  complete  rehearing before a different judge.'"

              "'Michaelmas Term   Children before Lord Hope, Deputy President Lord Rodger Lady Hale Lord Brown Lord Collins Lord Kerr Lord Clarke December Heard on and November Appellant Anthony Hayden Magdalen Case Respondent Susan Grocott Sasha Watkinson nd Respondent Frances Judd Alexander Kloss This is the judgment of the court. This case is about the proper approach to deciding who has been responsible for harming a child in proceedings taken to protect that child, and others in the family, from harm. It raises profound issues: on the one hand, children need to be protected from harm; but on the other hand, both they and their families need to be protected from the injustice and potential damage to their whole futures done by removing children from a parent who is not, in fact, responsible for causing them any harm at all. The facts of this case present us with that dilemma in an unusually stark form. The facts Because we have decided to allow this appeal and send the case back to be decided afresh, we should say only enough about the facts to explain how the dilemma arises. We shall use pseudonyms for the two children concerned, one who has been harmed and one who has not. Jason was born on May On June when he was just four weeks old, he was found to have bruising on his arms and face, which the doctors immediately thought was caused non-accidentally and not, as the mother suggested, by the baby pinching himself or sleeping on his dummy. Jason has not lived with his family since then, although he has had frequent and good quality contact with his mother. Jason was living with his mother and father at the time and described by the doctors as thriving. Both parents said that it was the father who had got up to attend to the baby when he woke up on the morning when the bruises were noticed. The mother took the baby to the clinic that morning and pointed them out to the health visitor. It was not possible to give precise timing for the bruises but it was not suggested that they were old or of different ages. They could have been inflicted by both parents, but the judge found it more likely that only one of them had inflicted them. The bruises had not been there for so long, nor would they have caused the baby such pain and distress, that the other parent must have known that he was being harmed. This was not, therefore, a case where one parent had failed to protect the child from harm caused by the other. It was, colloquially, a pure whodunit. The other child is William, born on July while the proceedings to protect Jason were in train. By then the parents had separated, although they were Page still in touch with one another. The father had stopped visiting Jason, had withdrawn from co-operation with the social workers and with his solicitors, and played no further part in the proceedings. He has parental responsibility for Jason but not for William. William was removed from his mother shortly after birth and placed with the same foster carer as his brother. He has never been harmed. The case for removing him from his mother rests on the likelihood of his being harmed in the future if he is returned to her. The law In this country we take the removal of children from their families extremely seriously. The Children Act was passed almost a decade before the Human Rights Act but its provisions were informed by the United Kingdoms obligations under article and article of the European Convention on Human Rights. These affect both the test and the process for intervening in the family lives of children and their parents. As to the test, it is not enough that the social workers, the experts or the court think that a child would be better off living with another family. That would be social engineering of a kind which is not permitted in a democratic society. The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights requires that there be a pressing social need for intervention and that the intervention be proportionate to that need. Before the court can consider what would be best for the child, therefore, section of the Act requires that it be satisfied of the so-called threshold conditions: that the child concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm; and that the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him; or the childs being beyond parental control. The leading case on the interpretation of these conditions is the decision of the House of Lords in Re Three propositions were established which have not been questioned since. First, it is not enough that the court suspects that a child may have suffered Page significant harm or that there was a real possibility that he did. If the case is based on actual harm, the court must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the child was actually harmed. Second, if the case is based on the likelihood of future harm, the court must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the facts upon which that prediction was based did actually happen. It is not enough that they may have done so or that there was a real possibility that they did. Third, however, if the case is based on the likelihood of future harm, the court does not have to be satisfied that such harm is more likely than not to happen. It is enough that there is a real possibility, a possibility that cannot sensibly be ignored having regard to the nature and gravity of the feared harm in the particular case Thus the law has drawn a clear distinction between probability as it applies to past facts and probability as it applies to future predictions. Past facts must be proved to have happened on the balance of probabilities, that is, that it is more likely than not that they did happen. Predictions about future facts need only be based upon a degree of likelihood that they will happen which is sufficient to justify preventive action. This will depend upon the nature and gravity of the harm: a lesser degree of likelihood that the child will be killed will justify immediate preventive action than the degree of likelihood that the child will not be sent to school. The House of Lords was invited to revisit the standard of proof of past facts in Re where the judge had been unable to decide whether the alleged abuse had taken place. The suggestion that it would be sufficient if there were a real possibility that the child had been abused was unanimously rejected. The House also reaffirmed that the standard of proof of past facts was the simple balance of probabilities, no more and no less. The problem had arisen, as Lord Hoffmann explained, because of dicta which suggested that the standard of proof might vary with the gravity of the misconduct alleged or even the seriousness of the consequences for the person concerned He pointed out that the cases in which such statements were made fell into three categories. In the first were cases which the law classed as civil but in which the criminal standard was appropriate. Into this category came sex offender orders and anti-social behaviour orders: see v Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary and v Crown Court at Manchester In the second were cases which were not about the standard of proof at all, but about the quality of evidence. If an event is inherently improbable, it may take better evidence to persuade the judge that it has happened than would be required if the event were a commonplace. This was what Lord Nicholls was discussing in Re Page above, at p Yet, despite the care that Lord Nicholls had taken to explain that having regard to the inherent probabilities did not mean that the standard of proof was higher, others had referred to a heightened standard of proof where the allegations were serious. In the third category, therefore, were cases in which the judges were simply confused about whether they were talking about the standard of proof or the role of inherent probabilities in deciding whether it had been discharged. Apart from cases in the first category, therefore, the time has come to say, once and for all, that there is only one civil standard of proof and that is proof that that the fact in issue more probably occurred than not This did, of course, leave a role for inherent probabilities in considering whether it was more likely than not that an event had taken place. But, as Lord Hoffmann went on to point out at para there was no necessary connection between seriousness and inherent probability: It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people, it would make no sense to start ones reasoning by saying that assaulting children is a serious matter and therefore neither of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the question for the tribunal is simply whether it is more probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator. Lady Hale made the same point, at para It may be unlikely that any person looking after a baby would take him by the wrist and swing him against the wall, causing multiple fractures and other injuries. But once the evidence is clear that that is indeed what has happened to the child, it ceases to be improbable. Someone looking after the child at the relevant time must have done it. The inherent improbability of the event has no relevance to deciding who that was. The simple balance of probabilities test should be applied. None of the parties in this case has invited the Supreme Court to depart from those observations, nor have they supported the comment made in the Court of Appeal that Re was a sweeping departure from the earlier authorities in the House of Lords in relation to child abuse, most obviously the case of Re All are agreed that Re reaffirmed the Page principles adopted in Re while rejecting the nostrum, the more serious the allegation, the more cogent the evidence needed to prove it, which had become a commonplace but was a misinterpretation of what Lord Nicholls had in fact said. Re was not a new departure in any context. Lord Hoffmann was merely repeating with emphasis what he had said in Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rehman at para differently constituted House of Lords applied the same approach in Re In Re the House also declined an invitation to overrule the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re and All This was concerned with the stage after the court is satisfied that the threshold has been crossed. The court has then to decide what order, if any, to make. The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration: Act, s In deciding whether or not to make a care or supervision order, the court must have regard in particular to the so-called checklist of factors: Act, s These include any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering. In Re and the Court of Appeal determined that section should be interpreted in the same way as section The court must reach a decision based on facts, not on suspicion or doubts. Butler-Sloss said this: point was that if there is a real possibility of harm in the past, then it must follow that there is a risk of harm in the future. To our minds, however, this proposition contains a non sequitur. The fact that there might have been harm in the past does not establish the risk of harm in the future. The very highest it can be put is that what might possibly have happened in the past means that there may possibly be a risk of the same thing happening in the future. Section however, does not deal with what might possibly have happened or what future risk there may possibly be. It speaks in terms of what has happened or what is at risk of happening. Thus, what the court must do is to decide whether the evidence establishes harm or the risk of harm. In agreeing with this approach in Re at para Lady Hale commented that in such a case, as indicated by Butler-Sloss the risk is not an actual risk to the child but a risk that the judge has got it wrong. We are all fallible human Page beings, very capable of getting things wrong. But until it has been shown that we have, it has not been shown that the child is in fact at any risk at all. Re and was also approved by Lord Nicholls in Re and another a case to which we shall return. The House in Re also recognised that courts and local authorities have different roles to play in protecting children from harm. It is worth re-emphasising this, given the understandable concerns in the wake of the Baby case that social workers and other professionals were not being sufficiently active in their protective role, and the resulting increase in the numbers of care proceedings. Social workers are the detectives. They amass a great deal of information about a child and his family. They assess risk factors. They devise plans. They put the evidence which they have assembled before a court and ask for an order. Article of the European Convention on Human Rights requires that In the determination of his civil rights and obligations, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The court subjects the evidence of the local authority to critical scrutiny, finds what the facts are, makes predictions based upon the facts, and balances a range of considerations in deciding what will be best for the child. We should no more expect every case which a local authority brings to court to result in an order than we should expect every prosecution brought by the to result in a conviction. The standard of proof may be different, but the roles of the social workers and the prosecutors are similar. They bring to court those cases where there is a good case to answer. It is for the court to decide whether the case is made out. If every child protection case were to result in an order, it would mean either that local authorities were not bringing enough cases to court or that the courts were not subjecting those cases to a sufficiently rigorous scrutiny. The whodunit problem So far the position is plain. But the threshold criteria do not in terms require that the person whose parental responsibility for the child is to be interfered with or even taken away by the order be responsible for the harm which the child has suffered or is likely to suffer in the future. It requires simply that the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him. Clearly, the object is to limit intervention to certain kinds of harm harm which should not happen if a child is being looked after properly. But is it also intended to limit intervention to cases where the Page person whose rights are to be interfered with bears some responsibility for the harm? It cannot have been intended that a parent whose child has been harmed as a result of a lack of proper care in a hospital or at school should be at risk of losing her child. The problem could be approached through the welfare test, because removal from home would not be in the best interests of such a child. However, because of the risk of social engineering, the threshold criteria were meant to screen out those cases where the family should not be put at any risk of intervention. Hence attention has focussed on the attributability criterion. In the case confusingly reported in the Law Reports as Lancashire County Council v but in the All England Law Reports as Lancashire County Council v All the House of Lords considered what is meant by the care given to the child. Does it mean only the care given by the parents or primary carers or does it mean the care given by anyone who plays a part in the childs care? Lord Nicholls, with whom Lord Slynn, Lord Nolan and Lord Hoffmann agreed, found that it referred primarily to the former. But if, as in that case, the care of the child was shared between two households and the judge could not decide which was responsible for the harm suffered by the child, the phrase is apt to embrace not merely the care given by the parents or other primary carers; it is apt to embrace the care given by any of the carers Thus the criteria were satisfied in respect of a child, who had been injured, even though this might have been attributable to the care she had received from her childminder rather than from her parents. Lord Clyde put the test in this helpful way, at p with the same result: That the harm must be attributable to the care given to the child requires that the harm must be attributable to the acts or omissions of someone who has the care of the child and the acts or omissions must occur in the course of the exercise of that care. To have the care of a child comprises more than being in a position where a duty of care towards the child may exist. It involves the undertaking of the task of looking after the child. However, it is worth noting that the Court of Appeal had confirmed that the criteria were not satisfied in respect of the childminders child, because he had not been harmed at all. The only basis for suggesting that there was any likelihood of harm to him was the possibility that his mother had harmed the other child and that had not been proved: Re applied. The local authority did not appeal against this. Page Re and another was concerned with the more common problem, where the child has been harmed at the hands of one of his parents but the court cannot decide which. The attributability condition was satisfied. Furthermore, when considering the welfare test, the court had to proceed on the basis that the child was at risk. Lord Nicholls, with whom all other members of the Committee agreed, said this, at para Quite simply, it would be grotesque if such a case had to proceed at the welfare stage on the footing that, because neither parent, considered individually, has been proved to be the perpetrator, therefore the child is not at risk from either of them. This would be grotesque because it would mean the court would proceed on the footing that neither parent represents a risk even though one or other of them was the perpetrator of the harm in question. Lord Nicholls went on, at para to give the following guidance, on the assumption that the hearing would be split into a fact-finding and a disposal stage and that each might be heard by a different judge: the judge at the disposal hearing will take into account any views expressed by the judge at the preliminary hearing on the likelihood that one carer was or was not the perpetrator, or a perpetrator, of the circumstances, these views may be of considerable value in deciding the outcome of the application: for instance, whether the child should be rehabilitated with his mother. injuries. Depending on inflicted the In Re Lady Hale commented as follows at para The decisions in In re Lancashire County Council v and In re fit together as a coherent whole. The court must first be satisfied that the harm or likelihood of harm exists. Once that is established, ,the court has to decide what outcome will be best for the child. It is very much easier to decide upon a solution if the relative responsibility of the childs carers for the harm which she or another child has suffered can also be established. But the court cannot shut its eyes to the undoubted harm which has been suffered simply because it does not know who was responsible. The real answers to the dilemma posed by those cases lie elsewhere first, in a proper approach to the standard of Page proof, and second, in ensuring that the same judge hears the whole case. Split hearings are one thing; split judging is quite another. We are told that practice has now changed and that, barring accidents, the same judge does conduct both parts of a split hearing. Nevertheless, the main object of splitting the hearing is to enable facts to be found. If the threshold is not crossed, the case can be dismissed at that stage. If it is crossed, the professionals can base both their assessments and their further work with the family upon the facts found. It is not at all uncommon for parents to become much more open with the professionals when faced with the judges clear findings based upon what the evidence shows. Hence there should always be a judgment to explain his findings at that stage. These proceedings It was necessary to give the above account of the development of the law in order to understand what happened in these proceedings. The case was originally identified as suitable for a split hearing; then it was decided to hold a composite hearing; but for regrettable practical reasons, the hearing was split once more. By that stage, the father was playing no part, but for some unknown reason the local authority decided not to issue a witness summons to require his attendance. That is regrettable because the judge might well have found it easier to make clear findings had he given evidence. The mother played a full part in the proceedings and in the assessments, but only accepted that the bruises were non-accidentally caused after the possibility of a blood disorder had effectively been ruled out. The judge heard evidence over three days in January and three further days in March. She handed down a detailed judgment in note form on April. This was before the House of Lords decision in Re At the outset, under the heading Test, she directed herself as follows: The test have applied in relation to these findings is that set out in the House of Lords case of of The standard of proof apply is on the balance of probability. The allegations in this case are very serious indeed and in many respects are also very unusual. When apply the appropriate standard of proof, it has to be based on evidence of reliability and cogency equivalent to the gravity of the allegations. Page She then listed five questions, three of which are relevant to the issue before this Court: first, whether the child had suffered non-accidental injury; second whether the perpetrator could be identified; and third even if the perpetrator cannot be identified, can either of the parents be excluded as a perpetrator? However, having concluded that the injuries were non-accidental, she did not in terms ask herself whether she could identify the perpetrator. She simply listed the various factors which she took into account in relation to each parent. She indicated at the outset of her list relating to the father that there is a high index of suspicion in relation to the father and concluded that he could not be ruled out. There was no such index in relation to the mother but for a variety of reasons the judge also concluded that the mother could not be ruled out. The final hearing was listed for June but could not proceed. As suggested in Re the judge was invited to give an indication of the relative likelihood of father or mother being responsible for the injuries, in order to assist with the assessment process. In oral exchanges she indicated that it was more likely that the father was the perpetrator than the mother. In a written Adjunct to Judgment she explained that Invidious though it is to be too specific, but to help further assessments, am prepared to say that feel it likely that the father injured the child and likely that it was the mother. The final hearing eventually took place before the same judge in December with judgment in January Part of the reason for the delay was that the mother had been unwell following the birth of her second child, William, in July. At the final hearing, the judge was invited to revisit her findings in the light of Re in which judgment was given on June She declined to say that her finding meant that the father was the perpetrator of the injuries. She observed that: When one is deciding these issues, a judge frequently reluctantly comes to the conclusion that he cannot decide who is to blame between two parents or among more than two people who have had care of the child over the relevant period. However, although unable to form a definitive decision to the requisite standard, a judge can still have an impression, falling short of a finding, that the propensity of the parties and the surrounding circumstances make it more likely that it was one party than another. Hence the mother was not absolved as a really possible or likely perpetrator. This meant that the threshold was crossed, not only in relation to the child who had suffered harm, but also in relation to the child who had not. The fact that there was a real possibility that she had caused the injuries to Jason meant that there was a real possibility that she would injure William. Page After considering the welfare factors she concluded that the mothers vulnerable personality was such that she would need therapy in order to make the necessary changes so that she could provide a safe and stable upbringing for the children. Their lives could not be put on hold in the meantime. Hence the judge approved the care plan to place them both for adoption and made care and placement orders in respect of both children. She did, however, give the mother permission to appeal but this was not included in the original order drawn up by the court. Lord Justice Wall also gave permission to appeal, observing that the case provides a useful opportunity for the Court of Appeal to resolve a point which has arisen following the decision of the House of Lords in Re namely if only parents are in the frame for having injured a child but the judge cannot as between parents identify the perpetrator of the injuries, can that judge apportion likely responsibility between them? Before the Court of Appeal, however, this was not the main issue. It was argued that, following Re the test for identifying the perpetrator was the balance of probabilities and that the effect of the Adjunct to judgment was that this judge had in fact identified the father. The appeal was dismissed:  Identifying the perpetrator: the standard of proof The first question listed in the statement of facts and issues is whether it is now settled law that the test to be applied to the identification of perpetrators is the balance of probabilities. The parties are agreed that it is and they are right. It is correct, as the Court of Appeal observed, that Re was not directly concerned with the identification of perpetrators but with whether the child had been harmed. However, the observations of Lord Hoffmann and Lady Hale, quoted at paragraph above, make it clear that the same approach is to be applied to the identification of perpetrators as to any other factual issue in the case. This issue shows quite clearly that there is no necessary connection between the seriousness of an allegation and the improbability that it has taken place. The test is the balance of probabilities, nothing more and nothing less. Of course, it may be difficult for the judge to decide, even on the balance of probabilities, who has caused the harm to the child. There is no obligation to do so. As we have already seen, unlike a finding of harm, it is not a necessary ingredient of the threshold criteria. As Lord Justice Wall put it in Re  at para judges should not strain to identify the perpetrator as a result of the decision in Re Page If an individual perpetrator can be properly identified on the balance of probabilities, then it is the judges duty to identify him or her. But the judge should not start from the premise that it will only be in an exceptional case that it will not be possible to make such an identification. There are particular benefits in making such a finding in this context, especially where there is a split hearing. Miss Frances Judd on behalf of the childrens guardian in this case, has stressed that the guardian would rather have a finding on the balance of probabilities than no finding at all. There are many reasons for this. The main reason is that it will promote clarity in identifying the future risks to the child and the strategies necessary to protect him from them. For example, a different care plan may be indicated if there is a risk that the parent in question will ill-treat or abuse the child from the plan that may be indicated if there is a risk that she will be vulnerable to relationships with men who may ill-treat or abuse the child. Another important reason is that it will enable the professionals to work with the parent and other members of the family on the basis of the judges findings. As the Court of Appeal said in Re  at para It is paradigmatic of such cases that the perpetrator denies responsibility and that those close to or emotionally engaged with the perpetrator likewise deny any knowledge of how the injuries occurred. Any process, which encourages or facilitates frankness, is, accordingly, in our view, to be welcomed in principle. Often, it is not only the parents, but the grandparents and other members of the family, who may be the best resource to protect the child in the future but who are understandably reluctant to accept that someone close to them could be responsible for injuring a child. Once that fact is brought home to them by a clear finding based upon the evidence, they may be able to work with the professionals to keep the child within the family. the child, whatever the outcome of the proceedings: Re also suggested, at para that there would be long term benefits for Page we are also of the view that it is in the public interest that children have the right, as they grow into adulthood, to know the truth about who injured them when they were children, and why. Children who are removed from their parents as a result of non-accidental injuries have in due course to come to terms with the fact that one or both of their parents injured them. This is a heavy burden for any child to bear. In principle, children need to know the truth if the truth can be ascertained. If the judge cannot identify a perpetrator? The second and third questions in the statement of facts and issues ask whether judges should refrain from seeking to identify perpetrators at all if they are unable to do so on the civil standard and whether they should now be discouraged from expressing a view on the comparative likelihood as between possible perpetrators. These appear to be linked but they are distinct. As to the second, if the judge cannot identify a perpetrator or perpetrators, it is still important to identify the pool of possible perpetrators. Sometimes this will be necessary in order to fulfil the attributability criterion. If the harm has been caused by someone outside the home or family, for example at school or in hospital or by a stranger, then it is not attributable to the parental care unless it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it. Sometimes it will desirable for the same reasons as those given above. It will help to identify the real risks to the child and the steps needed to protect him. It will help the professionals in working with the family. And it will be of value to the child in the long run. In North Yorkshire County Council v  the child had suffered non-accidental injury on two occasions. Four people had looked after the child during the relevant time for the more recent injury and a large number of people might have been responsible for the older injury. The Court of Appeal held that the judge had been wrong to apply a no possibility test when identifying the pool of possible perpetrators. This was far too wide. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss at para preferred a test of a likelihood or real possibility. Miss Susan Grocott for the local authority, has suggested that this is where confusion has crept in, because in Re this test was adopted in relation to the prediction of the likelihood of future harm for the purpose of the threshold criteria. It was not intended as a test for identification of possible perpetrators. Page That may be so, but there are real advantages in adopting this approach. The cases are littered with references to a finding of exculpation or to ruling out a particular person as responsible for the harm suffered. This is, as the President indicated, to set the bar far too high. It suggests that parents and other carers are expected to prove their innocence beyond reasonable doubt. If the evidence is not such as to establish responsibility on the balance of probabilities it should nevertheless be such as to establish whether there is a real possibility that a particular person was involved. When looking at how best to protect the child and provide for his future, the judge will have to consider the strength of that possibility as part of the overall circumstances of the case. As to the third question, times have changed since Re Barring unforeseen accidents, the same judge will preside over both parts of the hearing. While it is helpful to have a finding as to who caused the injuries if such a finding can be made, the guardians view is that it is positively unhelpful to have the sort of indication of percentages that the judge was invited to give in this case. Lord Justice Thorpe suggested,  para that judges should be cautious about amplifying a judgment in which they have been unable to identify a perpetrator: better to leave it thus. We agree. The unasked question If the judge can identify a perpetrator on the balance of probabilities, what is to be done about the risk that he may be wrong and that some-one else was in fact responsible? We are indeed all fallible human beings. We can make mistakes, however hard we try to pay careful attention to the quality of the evidence before us and reach findings which are rationally based upon it. However, once the court has identified a perpetrator, the risk is not a proven risk to the child but a risk that the judge has got it wrong. Logically and sensibly, although the judge cannot discount that risk while continuing to hear the case, he cannot use it to conclude that there is a proven risk to the child. But all the evidence relating to all the risk factors that the judge has identified remains relevant in deciding what will be best for the child. And he must remain alive to the possibility of mistake and be prepared to think again if evidence emerges which casts new light on the evidence which led to the earlier findings. It is now well settled that a judge in care proceedings is entitled to revisit an earlier identification of the perpetrator if fresh evidence warrants this The guardian also submits that the professionals will find it easier to work with this approach. Page It is important not to exaggerate the extent of the problem. It only really arises in split hearings, which were not originally envisaged when the Children Act was passed. In a single hearing the judge will know what findings of fact have to be made to support his conclusions both as to the threshold and as to the future welfare of the child. Moreover, cases rarely come as neatly packaged as this one does. In most cases, the injuries are such that, even if one parent was not responsible for causing them, she was undoubtedly responsible for failing to protect the child from the person who did cause them. In many cases, there are other risks to the child besides the risk of physical injury. The evidence which is relevant to identifying the perpetrator will also be relevant to identifying the other risks to the child and to assessing what will be best for him in the future. But clearly the steps needed to protect against some risks will be different from the steps needed to protect against others. And the overall calculus of what will be best for the child in the future will be affected by the nature and extent of the identified risks. There are many, many factors bearing upon the childs best interests and the identification of risks is only one of them. The conclusion in this case We have every sympathy for the judge, who was only repeating the mantra which many other judges at every level had repeated in the past. But it is clear that she did misdirect herself on the standard of proof at the fact-finding hearing. Because she later said that she had simply been unable to decide, we do not think that we can accept the invitation of Mr Anthony Hayden on behalf of the mother, to treat her Adjunct to judgment as a finding that the father was the perpetrator. That was not what she thought she was doing. However, that was an ex post facto rationalisation on her part. We cannot know what finding she would have made had she directed herself correctly in the first place. It is only right, for the sake of these children and their mother, that they should have the whole case put before a different judge who can decide the matter on the right basis. There is a further reason to remit the case. The judge found the threshold crossed in relation to William on the basis that there was a real possibility that the mother had injured Jason. That, as already explained, is not a permissible approach to a finding of likelihood of future harm. It was established in Re and confirmed in Re that a prediction of future harm has to be based upon findings of actual fact made on the balance of probabilities. It is only once those facts have been found that the degree of likelihood of future events becomes the real possibility test adopted in Re It might have been open to the judge to find the threshold crossed in relation to William on a different basis, but she did not do so. Page The case may look very different now that the mothers life has moved on and in the mean time, thankfully, the children have been well protected from harm. The appeal is therefore allowed and the case remitted for a complete rehearing before a different judge.'"
