       "{'judgement': {'body': 'Hilary Term [2022] UKSC 6 On appeal from: [2020] HCJAC 22 JUDGMENT Craig (Appellant) v Her Majesty’s Advocate (for the Government of the United States of America) and another (Respondents) (Scotland) before  Lord Reed, President Lord Lloyd-Jones Lord Kitchin Lord Burrows Lord Stephens JUDGMENT GIVEN ON 23 February 2022  Heard on 25 November 2021  \\x0c  Appellant Aidan O’Neill QC Fred Mackintosh QC (Instructed by Dunne Defence) 1st Respondent (Her Majesty’s Advocate (for the Government of the United States of America)) Kenny McBrearty QC Lesley Irvine (Instructed by International Co-operation Unit, Crown Office) 2nd Respondent (Her Majesty’s Advocate General for Scotland) Andrew Webster QC (Instructed by Office of the Advocate General)   \\x0c    LORD REED: (with whom Lord Lloyd-Jones, Lord Kitchin, Lord Burrows and Lord Stephens agree) 1. This appeal concerns the powers of the Scottish Ministers. They exercise functions in relation to extradition proceedings in Scotland, but their powers are limited under the Scotland Act 1998 by a requirement not to act incompatibly with the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”). The appeal also raises issues under the constitutional law of the United Kingdom concerning the obligations of the Government in relation to the commencement of legislation which Parliament has enacted, and their obligations in relation to a declaration by a court that their conduct is unlawful. 2. The appeal arises from the unlawful failure of the Government (more specifically, the Home Secretary) to make a commencement order bringing into force provisions of an Act of Parliament which are designed for the protection of individuals whose extradition has been requested. That failure was successfully challenged by an individual whose extradition was sought, in proceedings in which the court issued a final order declaring that the Government were acting unlawfully and contrary to their duties under the Act of Parliament. Notwithstanding the court’s order, the Government’s failure to make the commencement order subsequently continued over a period of years, during which the extradition proceedings were pursued against the individual who had obtained the court order. The question which now arises is whether the conduct of the proceedings under those circumstances, and the extradition order made in those proceedings, are legally valid. 1. The legislative background In October 2010 the Home Secretary appointed a panel chaired by the Rt Hon 3. Sir Scott Baker to conduct a review of the UK’s extradition arrangements, including the question whether a forum bar to extradition - that is to say, a bar to extradition on the ground that the UK was a more appropriate forum for prosecution - should be introduced. In the course of the review, the panel received representations on behalf of the Lord Advocate which opposed the introduction of a forum bar on the ground that it could involve the review by the courts of a prosecutorial decision. The review concluded that a forum bar should not be introduced. In March 2012 the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee published its 4. report, The US-UK Extradition Treaty (HC 644). It noted that the question of forum had been a significant issue in US-UK extradition cases, including cases concerned with the use of computers in the UK to commit alleged offences under US law. It concluded that Page 2 \\x0c    the current arrangements for determining the forum in which a person should be tried were unsatisfactory. It appeared to be very easy to engage the jurisdiction of the US courts without ever entering the country, since activity on the internet could involve the use of communications systems based in the US. Decisions as to forum were made by prosecutors behind closed doors, without the accused having any opportunity to make representations. Fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law required that justice was seen to be done in public. The Committee accordingly believed that it would be in the interests of justice for decisions about forum, in cases where there was concurrent jurisdiction, to be taken by a judge in open court, where the person whose extradition was requested would have the opportunity to put his case, rather than in private by prosecutors. The Committee therefore recommended that the Government introduce a forum bar as soon as possible. Some months later the Government published The Government Response to Sir 5. Scott Baker’s Review of the United Kingdom’s Extradition Arrangements (Cm 8458, October 2012), in which they rejected the review’s recommendation in relation to forum bar, and announced that they would seek to legislate for a forum bar, for the reasons given by the Committee. They duly did so in February 2013, when they introduced a suitable amendment to the Crime and Courts Bill then before Parliament. In 2013 Parliament enacted the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (“the 2013 Act”). 6. Paragraphs 1 to 3 of Schedule 20, to which effect is given by section 50, amend Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”), concerned with extradition to category 1 territories, so as to introduce a forum bar defence. Paragraphs 4 to 6 make similar amendments to Part 2 of the 2003 Act, concerned with extradition to category 2 territories, including the US. I shall refer to these provisions as the forum bar provisions. In particular, paragraph 5 of Schedule 20 to the 2013 Act inserts into section 7. 79(1) of the 2003 Act, which requires the judge to decide whether a person’s extradition to a category 2 territory is barred by reason of one or more of a number of considerations, an additional consideration, namely “(e) forum”. In that regard, section 79(2) is also amended so as to provide that sections 83A to 83E (in addition to sections 80 to 83, in the unamended version) apply for the interpretation of section 79(1). Paragraph 6 of Schedule 20 to the 2013 Act also inserts into the 2003 Act the new sections 83A to 83E. 8. Section 83A provides in subsection (1) that the extradition of a person (“D”) to a category 2 territory is barred by reason of forum if the extradition would not be in the interests of justice. For that purpose, subsection (2) provides that the extradition would not be in the interests of justice if the judge (a) decides that a substantial Page 3 \\x0c    measure of D’s relevant activity was performed in the UK and (b) decides, having regard to the matters specified in subsection (3) (and only those matters), that the extradition should not take place. The matters specified in subsection (3) are: “(a) the place where most of the loss or harm resulting from the extradition offence occurred or was intended to occur; (b) the interests of any victims of the extradition offence; any belief of a prosecutor [defined by section 83E(2) (c) as meaning a person who has responsibility for prosecuting offences in any part of the United Kingdom] that the United Kingdom, or a particular part of the United Kingdom, is not the most appropriate jurisdiction in which to prosecute D in respect of the conduct constituting the extradition offence; (d)  were D to be prosecuted in a part of the United Kingdom for an offence that corresponds to the extradition offence, whether evidence necessary to prove the offence is or could be made available in the United Kingdom; any delay that might result from proceeding in one (e) jurisdiction rather than another; the desirability and practicability of all prosecutions (f) relating to the extradition offence taking place in one jurisdiction, having regard (in particular) to - the jurisdictions in which witnesses, co-(i) defendants and other suspects are located, and the practicability of the evidence of such (ii) persons being given in the United Kingdom or in jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom; (g) D’s connections with the United Kingdom.” Page 4 \\x0c    The Divisional Court has described section 83A as “clearly intended to provide a 9. safeguard for requested persons, not distinctly to be found in any of the other bars to extradition or grounds for discharge, including section 87 and the wide scope of article 8 of the Convention”, and has identified its underlying aim as being “to prevent extradition where the offences can be fairly and effectively tried here, and it is not in the interests of justice that the requested person should be extradited”: Love v Government of the United States of America [2018] EWHC 172 (Admin); [2018] 1 WLR 2889, para 22. The court also observed (ibid) that the matters listed in section 83A(3) “do not leave to the court the task of some vague or broader evaluation of what is just. Nor is the bar a general provision requiring the court to form a view directly on which is the more suitable forum, let alone having regard to sentencing policy or the potential for prisoner transfer, save to the extent that one of the listed factors might in any particular case require consideration of it”. 10. The forum bar provisions enable the domestic prosecution authorities to have an input into the question whether a requested person should be extradited in one of two ways. First, under section 83A(3)(c), a prosecutor can express a belief that the UK, or a particular part of it, is not the most appropriate jurisdiction for a prosecution. Such a belief is a matter to which the court must have regard, but it is not conclusive. Secondly, sections 83B to 83D make provision for a “prosecutor’s certificate” to be given by a designated prosecutor (an expression which includes a prosecutor who is designated by subordinate legislation, or is within a description of prosecutors so designated) where (a) a formal decision has been made that the requested person should not be prosecuted, on the ground that there would be insufficient admissible evidence or that the prosecution would not be in the public interest, or (b) the prosecutor believes that the person should not be prosecuted because of concerns about the disclosure of sensitive material. If produced, such a certificate requires the appropriate judge to decide that extradition is not barred by reason of forum. The designated prosecutor’s decision relating to the certificate can, however, be questioned on appeal. In Scotland, such an appeal lies to the High Court of Justiciary. In determining such a question, the court is directed to “apply the procedures and principles that would be applied by it on an application for judicial review”: section 83D(3). In a case where the High Court of Justiciary quashes the prosecutor’s certificate, it must decide the issue of forum bar for itself. Transitional provisions are set out in paragraph 7 of Schedule 20 to the 2013 11. Act. They provide that in a case where the Part 1 warrant or (in a Part 2 case, such as the present) the request for the person’s extradition has been issued before the amendments come into force, those amendments apply to the extradition concerned only if, at that time, the judge has not yet decided all of the existing extradition bar questions, ie the questions in section 11(1) of the 2003 Act (in the case of a Part 1 Page 5 \\x0c    warrant) or section 79(1) of that Act (in a Part 2 case), as those questions stand before their amendment. Commencement provisions are set out in section 61 of the 2013 Act. Subject to 12. exceptions which are not relevant to the present case, section 61(2) provides: “… this Act comes into force on such day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint; and different days may be appointed for different purposes and, in the case of Part 4 of Schedule 16 and section 44 so far as relating to that Part of that Schedule, for different areas …” 13. Section 50 and Schedule 20 were brought into force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 14 October 2013. They were not brought into force in Scotland. It was found in the courts below that that was because of the Government’s sensitivity to the views of the Scottish Ministers, ie the members of the devolved Scottish Government: Scotland Act 1998, section 44(2). In particular, the Lord Advocate, who is one of the Scottish Ministers (Scotland Act, section 44(1)), regarded the provisions relating to the questioning of the prosecutor’s certificate as an inappropriate interference with his independence. 14. That finding was based on a body of material before Parliament. In particular, on the day when the provisions were introduced into Parliament as amendments to the Bill then before it, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office informed the House of Commons Public Bill Committee that “because Scottish Ministers and courts have a role in the process, we have decided that the provisions should be commenced only with their consent”. That decision was not, however, reflected in the terms of the legislation which Parliament enacted. Nevertheless, in evidence given to Parliament in 2014, the Lord Advocate stated that the provisions would only be brought into force in Scotland if the Scottish Ministers requested it, and that they had no intention to do so for the foreseeable future. That was confirmed by the Minister of State at the Home Office in answer to a Parliamentary question on 21 December 2017: “The Scottish Government has decided that it does not wish section 50 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 to be commenced in full in Scotland and there is no timetable for its commencement. This is a decision for the Scottish Government and there have been no recent discussions on Page 6 \\x0c    the issue.” (House of Commons Daily Report, 21 December 2017, pp 131-132) Contrary to that statement, this was not a decision for the Scottish Government. Under section 61, the decision was for the Secretary of State alone. 2. The present proceedings 15.  On 15 May 2017 the US Government made a request for the extradition of the appellant, Mr James Craig, under Part 2 of the 2003 Act. The appellant is a British citizen living in Scotland. Extradition proceedings in Scotland are conducted by the Lord Advocate, in accordance with section 191 of the 2003 Act. The decision whether to make an extradition order, under section 93 of that Act read together with section 141, is the responsibility of the Scottish Ministers. 16. The appellant is accused of an offence relating to a fraudulent scheme. The US indictment alleges that he posted false information on Twitter in order to reduce the value of shares in US-based companies, so that he could purchase the shares and resell them on advantageous terms. This is said to have resulted in losses to shareholders exceeding $1.6m. In a supporting affidavit it is said that one of the accounts used to buy the shares was held in the name of the appellant’s girlfriend and registered to the appellant’s home address in Scotland, and that incriminating evidence was found on electronic devices seized during a search of that address. Following receipt of the request, a warrant for the appellant’s arrest was issued 17. under section 71 of the 2003 Act. On 28 June 2017 he appeared in court and was admitted to bail in accordance with section 72. A date was fixed for the extradition hearing, but the hearing was subsequently adjourned in order to allow the appellant to bring the proceedings described in the next paragraph. 18. In March 2018 the appellant began proceedings for judicial review of the Government’s failure to commence the forum bar provisions in relation to Scotland, so as to be able to mount a defence under those provisions. The respondents to the proceedings were the Advocate General for Scotland, representing the Government in accordance with the Crown Suits (Scotland) Act 1857, and the Scottish Ministers. Counsel appearing on behalf of the Advocate General, who also appeared on 19. behalf of the Advocate General at the hearing of the present appeal, was either unable or unwilling to provide any explanation for the Government’s failure to bring the Page 7 \\x0c    forum bar provisions into force in Scotland, and was equally unable or unwilling to provide any explanation for the failure to provide an explanation. In any event, it was argued, the ministerial statements referred to in para 14 above did not indicate that the provisions would never be brought into force in Scotland, or that there had been a delegation of responsibility to the Scottish Ministers. Section 61 of the 2013 Act, it was argued, permitted the provisions to be brought into force at different times in different parts of the UK. 20. In his judgment, given on 12 December 2018, the Lord Ordinary, Lord Malcolm, rejected these contentions and held that the Government’s continuing failure to bring the forum bar provisions into force in Scotland was unlawful: Craig v Advocate General for Scotland [2018] CSOH 117; 2019 SC 230. He noted that the relevant words in section 61 (“this Act comes into force on such day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint”) were virtually identical to those of the commencement provisions which were in issue in the leading case of R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Fire Brigades Union [1995] 2 AC 513 (“the Fire Brigades Union case”). The power given in the subsequent words in section 61 (quoted at para 12 above) to appoint different days for different areas was clearly limited to section 44 and Part 4 of Schedule 16, which did not concern the forum bar provisions. It did not extend to section 50 and Schedule 20. It was also relevant that section 61(10) prohibited the making of a commencement order in respect of section 49 or Schedule 19 unless the Secretary of State had consulted the Scottish Ministers. No such provision was made in respect of section 50 and Schedule 20. Accordingly, Parliament intended that the forum bar provisions would be brought into law throughout the UK, and section 61 conferred no power to do so at different times in different parts of the UK. 21. Lord Malcolm dealt with the other aspects of the case on the basis of the principles established in the Fire Brigades Union case. The lesson of that case was that, absent a good reason to delay commencement, a failure to do so amounted to an abuse of power. It was equally an abuse of power if the relevant minister renounced the commencement power, failed to keep the matter under review, or delegated decision-making to a third party. In the circumstances before the court, it was clear from the answer given by the Minister of State (para 14 above) that the UK Government had decided not to bring the provisions into force, and that that would not change unless and until the Scottish Government altered their view on the matter. But a change in the view of the Scottish Government would merely return matters to the position as decided by Parliament at the outset. 22.  On the same date, Lord Malcolm made an order in which he “found and declared that in its continuing failure to bring into force in Scotland the extradition forum bar provisions in section 50 of, and Schedule 20 to, the Crime and Courts Act Page 8 \\x0c    2013, the UK Government is acting unlawfully and contrary to its duties under section 61 of the Act”. Counsel for the appellant did not seek an order requiring the Government to bring the forum bar provisions into force in Scotland, as it was assumed that they would do so in compliance with the declaratory order. 23.  No appeal was taken against that decision, which became final. Nevertheless, the Government’s failure to make a commencement order continued. The appellant’s extradition hearing took place six months later, on 13 June 24. 2019, before Sheriff Norman McFadyen. Prior to the hearing, the appellant gave notice of his intention to raise a devolution issue within the meaning of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act. Paragraph 1(d) of that Schedule includes within the definition of “devolution issue” a question “whether a purported or proposed exercise of a function by a member of the Scottish Government is, or would be, incompatible with any of the Convention rights”. The term “functions” is defined by section 126 of the Scotland Act as including powers and duties. 25.  On behalf of the appellant, it was argued at the hearing that his extradition would be incompatible with article 8 of the Convention, and was therefore beyond the powers of the Scottish Ministers, including the Lord Advocate, by reason of section 57(2) of the Scotland Act. That section provides: “A member of the Scottish Government has no power to make any subordinate legislation, or to do any other act, so far as the legislation or act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights.” Article 8 of the Convention requires that any interference with the appellant’s right to respect for his private and family life, such as would result from his extradition, must be “in accordance with the law”. It was argued that that requirement was not met, by reason of the Government’s continuing unlawful failure to commence the forum bar provisions. In the course of the argument, it was accepted that the appellant had to show that he would have had a real prospect of meeting the test in section 83A, were it in force. In response, it was submitted on behalf of the Lord Advocate that the failure to 26. commence the forum bar provisions was merely a procedural irregularity, and made no difference, as questions relating to forum could be addressed under the unamended provisions of the 2003 Act. In that regard, reference was made to section Page 9 \\x0c    87, which requires the judge to “decide whether the person’s extradition would be compatible with the Convention rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act”, and, if not, to order the person’s discharge. The principle of legality under article 8 was said not to have been violated, as the unamended provisions of the 2003 Act complied with that principle. Notwithstanding the appellant’s reliance upon section 57(2) of the Scotland Act, which renders acts ultra vires if they are incompatible with Convention rights, the arguments of both parties before the Sheriff (and also, subsequently, before the High Court of Justiciary) proceeded on the basis that, if the appellant’s submissions were well-founded, he would be entitled to be discharged in accordance with section 87 of the 2003 Act. 27.  On 4 July 2019 the Sheriff held that there was no bar to extradition under section 79 of the 2003 Act, and that the appellant’s extradition would be compatible with his Convention rights. He accordingly sent the case to the Scottish Ministers for their decision as to whether the appellant should be extradited: HM Advocate v Craig (unreported). He rejected the Lord Advocate’s contentions that the failure to commence the forum bar provisions was merely a procedural irregularity, and that it made no difference. As he observed, if the provisions made no difference, it would be hard to see why they were enacted or why the Lord Advocate opposed their commencement. He did not accept that the application of Convention rights under section 87 of the 2003 Act would necessarily bring about the same result as the application of the statutory bar arising under sections 83A to 83E, although it might do in some cases. He considered that the court had to respond to the unlawful character of the non-commencement of the forum bar provisions by attempting to apply section 87 in a way which was, so far as possible, compatible with those provisions. He commented that it was unsatisfactory that the court had in effect to apply section 83A by the back door. 28. Approaching matters on that basis, the Sheriff considered whether the appellant was likely to have succeeded in a forum bar defence if the provisions had been in force. He felt able to decide that a substantial measure of the appellant’s relevant activity was performed within the UK, as required by section 83A(2). In relation to the matters specified in section 83A(3), little information was available, and no consideration had been given to those matters by the Crown. Nevertheless, carrying out this “hypothetical exercise” (para 50) as best he could under the circumstances, the Sheriff concluded that a forum bar defence under section 83A, if it had been in force, would have been unlikely to succeed. In the light of that conclusion, he considered that the argument on legality, under article 8, did not arise (para 52), and that the appellant’s extradition would be compatible with the Convention rights. Page 10 \\x0c    29.  On 6 September 2019 the Scottish Ministers decided under section 93 of the 2003 Act that the appellant should be extradited. The appellant then appealed to the High Court of Justiciary (the Lord Justice 30. Clerk, Lady Dorrian, Lord Brodie and Lord Turnbull) under section 103 of the 2003 Act. The appeal was heard on 23 January 2020 and refused on 3 June 2020: Craig v HM Advocate [2020] HCJAC 22; 2020 JC 258. Before the High Court, it was argued on behalf of the appellant that the Sheriff 31. had erred in attempting to apply the forum bar provisions, since they were not in force. Their effect could not in any event be replicated by section 87 of the 2003 Act, since the focus of the forum bar provisions, and the considerations which had to be taken into account, were different from those applicable under the Convention. The Sheriff should instead have focused on the legal consequences of the Government’s unlawful failure to bring the provisions into force, thereby unlawfully depriving the appellant of the forum bar defence which would have been available if a commencement order had been made. In those circumstances, the extradition proceedings failed to comply with the article 8 requirement of legality. Those arguments were rejected. The Lord Justice Clerk, with whose reasoning 32. the other members of the court agreed, considered that the legal consequences of the unlawful failure to commence the forum bar provisions depended on the extent to which the appellant had been prevented from relying on arguments which could otherwise have been made. That could be considered as part of the court’s assessment under section 87. In applying that section, the Sheriff “would of course be expected to include as part of the balancing exercise the fact that the non-commencement of the forum bar provisions in Scotland has been found to be unlawful” (para 30). That would require the Sheriff “to take into account … the potential prejudice to an applicant of the failure to introduce provisions” (ibid). That was what the Sheriff had done. 33.  On 28 August 2020 the High Court granted leave to appeal to this court on the article 8 issue. In doing so, it must have recognised that it had determined a devolution issue, as no appeal would otherwise have lain from its decision: section 114(13) of the 2003 Act. 34.  On 6 September 2021 the Secretary of State made the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (Commencement No 19) Order 2021 (SI 2021/1018), which brought section 50 of and Schedule 20 to the 2013 Act - that is to say, the forum bar provisions - into force in Scotland. The provisions do not apply to the appellant, if the Sheriff’s decision of 4 July 2019 is valid. That is because, as explained in para 11 above, paragraph 7 of Schedule Page 11 \\x0c    20 to the 2013 Act provides that where, in a Part 2 case such as the present, the request for the person’s extradition has been issued before the amendments come into force, those amendments apply to the extradition concerned only if, at that time, the judge has not yet decided all of the existing extradition bar questions, ie the questions in section 79(1) of the 2003 Act, as those questions stand before their amendment. Those questions were purportedly decided by the Sheriff on 4 July 2019, more than two years before the amendments were brought into force. 3. The legal issues arising on the present appeal (i) Two preliminary issues Two preliminary issues need to be addressed before considering the principal 35. questions in the appeal. 36. First, it is a matter of agreement between the parties that the High Court of Justiciary’s order of 3 June 2020 determined the devolution issue which had been raised on behalf of the appellant, and that this is accordingly an appeal under paragraph 13 of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act. Such an appeal is not excluded by the 2003 Act: see the decision of this court in H v Lord Advocate [2012] UKSC 24; [2013] 1 AC 413; 2012 SC (UKSC) 308, given statutory effect in section 116 of the 2003 Act, as amended by paragraph 26 of Schedule 20 to the 2013 Act. The Advocate General for Scotland represents the Government in this appeal, as he is entitled to do by virtue of paragraphs 5 and 6 of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act. Secondly, it follows that the question which ultimately requires to be answered 37. is not whether the appellant is entitled to be discharged under section 87 of the 2003 Act. The question is whether the Lord Advocate and the Scottish Ministers were acting ultra vires in performing their functions in relation to the appellant’s extradition. It is a matter of agreement that they had no power to do so, by reason of section 57(2) of the Scotland Act (para 25 above), if in doing so they were acting incompatibly with the appellant’s Convention rights. Accordingly, if the appeal is allowed, the court has available to it all the powers set out in rule 29(1) of the Supreme Court Rules 2009 (SI 2009/1603), in terms of which “the Supreme Court has all the powers of the court below and may - (a) affirm, set aside or vary any order or judgment made or given by that court; (b) remit any issue for determination by that court; (c) order a new trial or hearing”. Page 12 \\x0c    (ii) Issues relating to the effect of the declaratory order It is necessary next to consider the effect of the declaratory order granted by 38. Lord Malcolm. That necessity arises in the light of the submissions made to this court by counsel appearing on behalf of the Advocate General. Counsel stated, on behalf of the Home Secretary, that she accepted that 39. successive Secretaries of State had acted unlawfully. It had been believed that the commencement provisions permitted the commencement of the forum bar provisions in only part of the UK. The court had told the Secretary of State that that belief was wrong. However, by making a declaratory order and refraining from granting an order for specific performance (a remedy available in Scotland for the enforcement of statutory duties, by virtue of section 45 of the Court of Session Act 1988) - which, counsel said, it could have done - the court had told the Secretary of State that the failure to commence the provisions was unlawful, but not that the provisions had to be commenced. Notwithstanding the court’s order, the Lord Advocate’s concerns about the forum bar provisions remained. The Secretary of State therefore had to decide whether to impose the forum bar provisions despite the constitutional problem arising from those concerns, or to repeal the provisions for the whole of the UK (by which counsel presumably meant that the Secretary of State had to decide whether to propose to Parliament a legislative measure which, if enacted, would have that effect). The time taken to consider that question was said to explain the delay between December 2018, when the Secretary of State was declared to be acting unlawfully, and September 2021, when the commencement order was made. In written submissions, counsel also contended that, following the declaratory 40. order, it was for any party who sought to rely on the provisions not commenced to apply for an order for specific performance requiring the Home Secretary to bring them into effect. The effect of the declaratory order was not that the forum bar provisions were unlawfully excluded from the extradition scheme, but that they were “lawfully recognised as not part of the scheme, but on a basis that could be relied upon to bring them within the scheme if desired”. It seems, therefore, that the order was not regarded as having any practical implications for the Home Secretary unless and until a further, coercive, order was sought and obtained. The submissions which I have summarised reveal a number of 41. misunderstandings. First, Lord Malcolm did not merely reject the contention that section 61 of the 2013 Act permitted the commencement of the forum bar provisions in only part of the UK. As was explained at para 21 above, he also made it clear that the Scottish Ministers’ opposition to the provisions was not a lawful justification for the failure to bring them into force in Scotland: Parliament had decided, in enacting Page 13 \\x0c    section 61, that they were to be brought into force throughout the UK. In those circumstances, the explanation put forward for the delay in commencement following Lord Malcolm’s judgment simply reflects a perpetuation of the same error of law as underlay the delay in commencement before that judgment. Secondly, the order made by Lord Malcolm did not merely imply that the Home 42. Secretary had acted unlawfully in the past. It was expressed in the present tense: it declared that “in its continuing failure to bring into force in Scotland the extradition forum bar provisions … the UK government is acting unlawfully and contrary to its duties under section 61” (emphasis added). That order was not challenged, and became final. In the absence, at least, of any material change of circumstances - in which event I am inclined to think that the Secretary of State might have applied to the court for a further order declaring that the failure to commence the provisions was no longer unlawful - it was the duty of the Secretary of State to act in conformity with the court’s order (and, as I have explained in para 41, the Secretary of State’s decision not to exercise the power to make a commencement order, after the court’s order, was in any event unlawful, as it was vitiated by an error of law). 43. Thirdly, the argument that, where a statutory duty exists which is capable of being enforced by a coercive order, a party should apply for such an order against a Government minister, instead of relying upon compliance with a declaratory order, has implications for the constitutional relationship between the Government and the courts. In that regard, some general observations about the use of declaratory orders in 44. public law may be helpful. It has been firmly established since the case of M v Home Office [1994] 1 AC 377 that there is a clear expectation that the executive will comply with a declaratory order, and that it is in reliance on that expectation that the courts usually refrain from making coercive orders against the executive and grant declaratory orders instead. In that case, the House of Lords held that a mandatory interim injunction had been properly granted against the Home Secretary, and that, following his department’s breach of the injunction, he could properly be found in contempt of court (although no punishment was considered necessary beyond the payment of costs). Lord Woolf, with whom the other members of their Lordships’ House agreed, observed at p 397 that the fact that these issues had only arisen for the first time in that case was confirmation that in ordinary circumstances ministers of the Crown and government departments scrupulously observed decisions of the courts. He continued: “Because of this, it is normally unnecessary for the courts to make an executory order against a minister or a government Page 14 \\x0c    department since they will comply with any declaratory judgment made by the courts and pending the decision of the courts will not take any precipitous action.” (Emphasis added) He added at pp 422-423: “The fact that, in my view, the court should be regarded as having jurisdiction to grant interim and final injunctions against officers of the Crown does not mean that that jurisdiction should be exercised except in the most limited circumstances. In the majority of situations so far as final relief is concerned, a declaration will continue to be the appropriate remedy on an application for judicial review involving officers of the Crown. As has been the position in the past, the Crown can be relied upon to co-operate fully with such declarations.” The Government, for their part, have always accepted that they can be relied 45. upon to comply with declarations: see, for example, the recent case of Vince v Advocate General for Scotland [2019] CSIH 51; 2020 SC 90, where the court accepted the Government’s submission that it was unnecessary to make a coercive order against the Prime Minister, since members of the Government could be expected to respect a declaratory order. It is to be hoped that the submissions made on behalf of the Government in the present case do not represent a fully considered departure from that longstanding approach. The Government’s compliance with court orders, including declaratory orders, is 46. one of the core principles of our constitution, and is vital to the mutual trust which underpins the relationship between the Government and the courts. The courts’ willingness to forbear from making coercive orders against the Government, and to make declaratory orders instead, reflects that trust. But trust depends on the Government’s compliance with declaratory orders in the absence of coercion. In other words, it is because ours is a society governed by the rule of law, where the Government can be trusted to comply with court orders without having to be coerced, that declaratory orders can provide an effective remedy. Although cases have occurred from time to time in which ministers have failed to comply with court orders (such as M v Home Office and the recent case of R (Majera (formerly SM (Rwanda)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2021] UKSC 46; [2021] 3 WLR 1075), they are exceptional, and can generally be attributed to mistakes and misunderstandings rather than deliberate disregard. However, where a legally enforceable duty to act, or to Page 15 \\x0c    refrain from acting, can be established, the court is capable of making a coercive order, as M v Home Office and Davidson v Scottish Ministers [2005] UKHL 74; 2006 SC (HL) 41 demonstrate. Furthermore, a declaratory order itself has important legal consequences. First, the legal issue which forms the subject matter of the declaration is determined and is res judicata as a result of the order being granted: St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust v S [1999] Fam 26, 59-60. In addition, a minister who acts in disregard of the law as declared by the courts will normally be acting outside his authority as a minister, and may consequently expose himself to a personal liability for wrongdoing: Dicey, Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution, 10th ed (1959), pp 193-194. (iii) Article 8 and the powers of the Scottish Ministers 47. It is necessary to consider next whether the acts of the Lord Advocate in conducting the extradition proceedings against the appellant, and the decision of the Scottish Ministers to order his extradition, were ultra vires by reason of their being incompatible with his rights under article 8 of the Convention. 48. Article 8 provides: Everyone has the right to respect for his private and “1. family life, his home and his correspondence. There shall be no interference by a public authority 2. with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” Where an act would constitute an interference with the right guaranteed by article 8(1), it is therefore necessary to consider three questions: first, whether the interference is “in accordance with the law”; secondly, whether the interference pursues one of the legitimate aims listed in article 8(2); and thirdly, whether the interference is “necessary in a democratic society”, that is to say, is a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim pursued, balancing the competing public and private interests in question. Page 16 \\x0c    In the present case, there is no dispute that the appellant’s extradition would 49. interfere with his right to respect for his private and family life under article 8(1). It therefore requires to be justified under article 8(2). The first question which arises under that provision is whether the interference is “in accordance with the law”. As the European Court of Human Rights stated in Halford v United Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 523, 544, para 49, and has repeated many times since, “this expression does not only necessitate compliance with domestic law, but also relates to the quality of that law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law”. Accordingly, the interference must, in the first place, be in conformity with domestic law. In addition, the domestic law must meet the requirements of the rule of law, so as to afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness. These matters were not addressed by the courts below. Although they accepted 50. that the Home Secretary had acted unlawfully in failing to commence the forum bar provisions in Scotland, they did not treat that continuing breach of the law as meaning that the interference with the appellant’s article 8 rights would not be “in accordance with the law”. Instead, they treated the unlawfulness, and any consequent prejudice suffered by the appellant through his inability to invoke the forum bar provisions, as a matter which could be fully taken into account as a factor in the balancing exercise between the public and private interests involved: see paras 27-28 and 32 above. In other words, they did not address the first question identified in para 48 above, and instead proceeded directly to the third question, treating the Home Secretary’s failure to comply with section 61 of the 2013 Act as having a potential bearing on that issue. That was a mistaken approach. As was said in In re Gallagher; R (P) v Secretary of State for Justice [2019] UKSC 3; [2020] AC 185, para 12, the requirement that an interference must be in accordance with the law is an absolute requirement. In meeting it, Convention states have no margin of appreciation under the Convention, and the executive and the legislature have no margin of discretion or judgment under domestic public law. Only if the test of legality is satisfied does the question arise whether the measures in question are necessary for some legitimate purpose and represent a proportionate means of achieving that purpose. 51. In relation to the question whether the acts of the Lord Advocate and the Scottish Ministers were “in accordance with the law”, it was submitted on their behalf, and on behalf of the Advocate General, that the extradition proceedings had been conducted, and the extradition order made, in accordance with the provisions of the 2003 Act which were in force. Those provisions were evidently in compliance with domestic law, since they formed part of that law. They met the Convention requirements of accessibility and predictability. The fact that a forum bar defence had not been available was irrelevant, since the forum bar provisions were not in force, and therefore did not form part of domestic law with which it was necessary to comply. Page 17 \\x0c    The flaw in this argument is that the commencement provision, section 61 of 52. the 2013 Act, was undoubtedly in force and formed part of domestic law. The procedure followed was not in compliance with section 61, as Lord Malcolm had declared. That remained the position following his decision, as explained at paras 41-42 above, and as the courts below accepted. The procedure was therefore not in compliance with domestic law. It follows that it was not “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of article 8 of the Convention. In the light of that conclusion, the question which would have arisen on the Lord Advocate’s and Advocate General’s submissions, as to whether the treatment of the appellant (including the delay in complying with Lord Malcolm’s order) in any event complied with the rule of law, does not require to be determined. The consequence is that the acts of the Lord Advocate in conducting the 53. extradition proceedings, and the act of the Scottish Ministers in making the extradition order, were incompatible with the appellant’s Convention rights, and were therefore ultra vires by virtue of section 57(2) of the Scotland Act. In the language of paragraph 1(d) of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act (para 24 above), they were merely “purported” acts, and were therefore invalid. (iv) The appropriate remedy For these reasons, I would allow the appeal. I would leave it to the High Court of 54. Justiciary to make such orders as fall to be made in consequence of this judgment in order to enable a new extradition hearing to be held before a different Sheriff. At that hearing, it will be open to the appellant to rely on the forum bar provisions (in addition to any other arguments properly available to him), since the effect of this judgment is that the Sheriff has not yet decided the existing extradition bar questions, ie the questions in section 79(1) of the 2003 Act, as those questions stood before their amendment by the commencement order made in September 2021.

In May 2017, the US Government made a request for his extradition to the US, where he is accused of committing an offence relating to securities fraud.The process for determining whether a person should be extradited from the UK is governed by the Extradition Act 2003 (\"the 2003 Act\"). By the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (\"the 2013 Act\"), Parliament inserted into the 2003 Act a number of provisions referred to as \"the forum bar provisions\". These provisions aim to prevent extradition where the offences could be fairly and effectively tried in the UK, and it is not in the interests of justice that the requested person should be extradited. Section 61 of the 2013 Act provides that the forum bar provisions will \"come into force on such a day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint\". The Secretary of State brought the forum bar provisions into force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in October 2013, but he did not bring them into force in Scotland.Mr Craig wanted to rely on the forum bar provisions in the extradition proceedings brought against him in Scotland. He therefore issued a claim against the Advocate General for Scotland and the Scottish Ministers, arguing that the Secretary of State’s failure to bring the forum bar provisions into force in Scotland was unlawful. In December 2018, the Outer House of the Court of Session found in Mr Craig’s favour and made an order in which it \"declared… that in its continuing failure to bring into force in Scotland the extradition forum bar provisions… the UK Government is acting unlawfully and contrary to its duties under section 61 of [the 2013 Act]\".Notwithstanding that order, the UK Government failed to bring the forum bar provisions into force in Scotland until September 2021. In the meantime, the Lord Advocate continued to pursue extradition proceedings against Mr Craig. In July 2019, a sheriff decided that there was no bar to Mr Craig’s extradition under the 2003 Act and that his extradition would be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (\"the Convention\"). The sheriff sent the matter on to the Scottish Ministers, who in September 2019 decided that Mr Craig should be extradited to the US.Mr Craig appealed, unsuccessfully, to the High Court of Justiciary. He now appeals to the Supreme Court.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. A new extradition hearing may be held before a different sheriff, at which Mr Craig will be able to rely on the forum bar provisions (in addition to any other arguments properly available to him).Lord Reed gives the sole judgment, with which the other Justices agree.Reasons for the JudgmentSection 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998 provides that a \"member of the Scottish Government has no power to… act, so far as the… act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights\"[25]. This means that the Lord Advocate has no power to conduct extradition proceedings against Mr Craig, and the Scottish Ministers have no power to order his extradition, if those acts are incompatible with Mr Craig’s rights under the Convention[37], [47].There is no dispute that the extradition of Mr Craig would interfere with his right to respect for his private and family life, as guaranteed by article 8(1) of the Convention. Such an interference could, however, be justified under article 8(2), if it is \"in accordance with the law\", if it pursues a \"legitimate aim\", and if it is \"necessary in a democratic society\". To satisfy the first of those three requirements, the interference must be in conformity with domestic law and the domestic law must meet the requirements of the rule of law, so as to afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness. This is an absolute requirement. The executive is afforded no margin of discretion in meeting it[48]-[50].The interference with Mr Craig’s rights under article 8(1) was not \"in accordance with the law\", within the meaning of article 8(2)[52]. The order made by the Outer House in December 2018 was expressed in the present tense, making clear that the Secretary of State was \"continuing\" to act in breach of section 61 of the 2013 Act by failing to bring the forum bar provisions into force. The Secretary of State had a duty to act in conformity with that order, and his failure to do so was unlawful[41]-[42]. The extradition procedure followed in Mr Craig’s case did not therefore accord with section 61 of the 2013 Act[52].It is no answer to this that the order made by the Outer House was merely declaratory, rather than coercive[43]. It is firmly established that there is a clear expectation that the Government will comply with declaratory orders, and it is in reliance on that expectation that the courts usually refrain from making coercive orders against the Government and grant declaratory orders instead[44]. This is one of the core principles of our constitution. It is vital to the mutual trust which underpins the relationship between the Government and the courts[46].Accordingly, the extradition proceedings against Mr Craig were not conducted \"in accordance with the law\" and so were incompatible with his rights under article 8 of the Convention. It follows that the extradition order made against him is invalid[53].References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court’s decision.

In May 2017, the US Government made a request for his extradition to the US, where he is accused of committing an offence relating to securities fraud.The process for determining whether a person should be extradited from the UK is governed by the Extradition Act 2003 (\"the 2003 Act\"). By the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (\"the 2013 Act\"), Parliament inserted into the 2003 Act a number of provisions referred to as \"the forum bar provisions\". These provisions aim to prevent extradition where the offences could be fairly and effectively tried in the UK, and it is not in the interests of justice that the requested person should be extradited. Section 61 of the 2013 Act provides that the forum bar provisions will \"come into force on such a day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint\". The Secretary of State brought the forum bar provisions into force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in October 2013, but he did not bring them into force in Scotland.Mr Craig wanted to rely on the forum bar provisions in the extradition proceedings brought against him in Scotland. He therefore issued a claim against the Advocate General for Scotland and the Scottish Ministers, arguing that the Secretary of State’s failure to bring the forum bar provisions into force in Scotland was unlawful. In December 2018, the Outer House of the Court of Session found in Mr Craig’s favour and made an order in which it \"declared… that in its continuing failure to bring into force in Scotland the extradition forum bar provisions… the UK Government is acting unlawfully and contrary to its duties under section 61 of [the 2013 Act]\".Notwithstanding that order, the UK Government failed to bring the forum bar provisions into force in Scotland until September 2021. In the meantime, the Lord Advocate continued to pursue extradition proceedings against Mr Craig. In July 2019, a sheriff decided that there was no bar to Mr Craig’s extradition under the 2003 Act and that his extradition would be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (\"the Convention\"). The sheriff sent the matter on to the Scottish Ministers, who in September 2019 decided that Mr Craig should be extradited to the US.Mr Craig appealed, unsuccessfully, to the High Court of Justiciary. He now appeals to the Supreme Court.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. A new extradition hearing may be held before a different sheriff, at which Mr Craig will be able to rely on the forum bar provisions (in addition to any other arguments properly available to him).Lord Reed gives the sole judgment, with which the other Justices agree.Reasons for the JudgmentSection 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998 provides that a \"member of the Scottish Government has no power to… act, so far as the… act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights\"[25]. This means that the Lord Advocate has no power to conduct extradition proceedings against Mr Craig, and the Scottish Ministers have no power to order his extradition, if those acts are incompatible with Mr Craig’s rights under the Convention[37], [47].There is no dispute that the extradition of Mr Craig would interfere with his right to respect for his private and family life, as guaranteed by article 8(1) of the Convention. Such an interference could, however, be justified under article 8(2), if it is \"in accordance with the law\", if it pursues a \"legitimate aim\", and if it is \"necessary in a democratic society\". To satisfy the first of those three requirements, the interference must be in conformity with domestic law and the domestic law must meet the requirements of the rule of law, so as to afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness. This is an absolute requirement. The executive is afforded no margin of discretion in meeting it[48]-[50].The interference with Mr Craig’s rights under article 8(1) was not \"in accordance with the law\", within the meaning of article 8(2)[52]. The order made by the Outer House in December 2018 was expressed in the present tense, making clear that the Secretary of State was \"continuing\" to act in breach of section 61 of the 2013 Act by failing to bring the forum bar provisions into force. The Secretary of State had a duty to act in conformity with that order, and his failure to do so was unlawful[41]-[42]. The extradition procedure followed in Mr Craig’s case did not therefore accord with section 61 of the 2013 Act[52].It is no answer to this that the order made by the Outer House was merely declaratory, rather than coercive[43]. It is firmly established that there is a clear expectation that the Government will comply with declaratory orders, and it is in reliance on that expectation that the courts usually refrain from making coercive orders against the Government and grant declaratory orders instead[44]. This is one of the core principles of our constitution. It is vital to the mutual trust which underpins the relationship between the Government and the courts[46].Accordingly, the extradition proceedings against Mr Craig were not conducted \"in accordance with the law\" and so were incompatible with his rights under article 8 of the Convention. It follows that the extradition order made against him is invalid[53].References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court’s decision.

He and his employer were the subject of a criminal investigation by a UK Legal Enforcement Body (the \"UKLEB\"). During that investigation, the UKLEB sent a confidential Letter of Request (the \"Letter\") to the authorities of a foreign state seeking, among other things, information and documents relating to ZXC. The Letter expressly requested that its existence and contents remain confidential.The Appellant (\"Bloomberg\"), a well-known media company, obtained a copy of the Letter, on the basis of which it published an article reporting that information had been requested in respect of ZXC and detailing the matters in respect of which he was being investigated. After Bloomberg refused to remove the article from its website, and following an unsuccessful application for an interim injunction, ZXC brought a successful claim against Bloomberg for misuse of private information.ZXC claimed that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to: (1) the fact that the UKLEB had requested information relating to him in the context of its investigations, and (2) the details of the matters that the UKLEB was investigating in relation to him. The first instance judge held that Bloomberg had published private information that was in principle protected by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the \"ECHR\"); and that in balancing ZXC’s rights against those of Bloomberg under article 10 ECHR, the balance favoured ZXC. Bloomberg’s appeal against that judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Bloomberg now appeals to the Supreme Court.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. It holds that, in general, a person under criminal investigation has, prior to being charged, a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information relating to that investigation. Lord Hamblen and Lord Stephens give the sole joint judgment, with which the other Justices agree.Reasons for the JudgmentAs is now well established, and was common ground, misuse of private information is a distinct tort where liability is determined by applying a two-stage test. Stage one is whether the claimant objectively has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the relevant information considering all the circumstances of the case. Such circumstances are likely to include, but are not limited to, those identified in the Court of Appeal’s decision in Murray v Express Newspapers plc [2008] EWCA Civ 446 at para 36 (the so-called \"Murray factors\") [48-55]. If so, stage two is whether that expectation is outweighed by the publisher’s right to freedom of expression. This involves a balancing exercise between the claimant’s article 8 ECHR right to privacy and the publisher’s article 10 ECHR right to freedom of expression, having due regard to section 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998 [56-62].Issue 1: The stage one test and whether the Court of Appeal was correct to hold that there is a general rule, applicable in the present case, that a person under criminal investigation has, prior to being charged, a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information relating to that investigation.It is widely accepted as a matter of public policy that there is a negative effect on an innocent person’s reputation in publishing that he or she is being investigated by the police or another state organisation. There is a uniform general practice by state investigatory bodies not to identify those under investigation prior to charge [80-89]. Additionally, several first instance judgments have accepted the private nature of such information based on the potential that its publication would ordinarily cause substantial damage to the person’s reputation, and other damage [90-99].Bloomberg advanced four arguments challenging the general rule or legitimate starting point in relation to this category of information, all of which the court rejects [74].First, Bloomberg submitted that given the public’s ability to observe the presumption of innocence, the application of a general rule or legitimate starting point is unsound because it overstates the extent to which publishing the information will cause damage to the claimant’s reputation. The presumption of innocence is a legal presumption applicable to criminal trials. But in this different context, the question is how others, including a person’s inner circle, will react to the publication of information that that person is under criminal investigation. It is undeniable that a person’s reputation will ordinarily be adversely affected, impacting their right to respect for private life such as the right to establish and develop relationships with other people [100-109].Second, Bloomberg argued that the courts’ reliance below on the \"human characteristic\" to equate suspicion or investigation with guilt on the assumption that there is \"no smoke without fire\" runs contrary to well-established principles in defamation law such that the ordinary reasonable reader can distinguish suspicion from guilt and is not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. But ZXC did not bring a claim in defamation. The tort of misuse of private information is a separate tort with different constituent elements and a distinct purpose. Unlike in defamation, the purpose of the tort of misuse of private information is not only to protect an individual from the publication of untrue information. Rather, its purpose is to protect an individual’s private life in accordance with article 8 ECHR, regardless of the truth or falsity of the information, and it is therefore inappropriate to read across concepts from the tort of defamation [110-113].Third, Bloomberg submitted that information should not be protected because it’s reputationally damaging but rather because it belongs to a part of the claimant’s life which is of no-one else’s concern and that does not include ZXC’s business activities. This is an unduly restrictive view of the protection afforded by article 8 ECHR, which can include professional or business activities. A person’s reputation is within the scope of their article 8 ECHR \"private life\" provided the attack on reputation attains a certain level of seriousness and prejudices a person’s right to respect for private life [114-125].Fourth, Bloomberg argued the courts below failed to apply the correct legal test at stage one, involving a consideration of \"all the circumstances of the case\", which should have included the activity in which ZXC was engaged, namely \"alleged corruption in relation to ZXC’s company’s activities in a foreign country\". The nature of the activity in which ZXC was engaged is not a factor of particular significance here. The courts below gave due consideration to the applicable Murray factors in their multi-factorial analysis, including ZXC’s status as a businessman involved in the affairs of a large public company. Whilst ZXC’s status might mean that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider than for a private individual, there is a limit. The factor is not in itself determinative and should only form part of the stage one analysis [126-143].Therefore, the courts below were correct to hold that, as a legitimate starting point, a person under criminal investigation has, prior to being charged, a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information relating to that investigation and that in all the circumstances this is a case in which that applies and there is such an expectation [144-145].Issue 2: Whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to hold that, in a case in which a claim for breach of confidence was not pursued, the fact that Bloomberg published information originating from a confidential law enforcement document rendered the information private and/or undermined Bloomberg’s ability to rely on the public interest in its disclosure.The judge was right to treat the Letter’s confidentiality as a relevant and important factor at both stage one and stage two but neither the judge nor the Court of Appeal held that the Letter’s confidentiality itself rendered the information private or prevented Bloomberg from relying on the public interest on its disclosure. Whilst there is no necessary overlap between the distinct actions for misuse of private information and for breach of confidence, confidentiality and privacy will often overlap, and if information is confidential that is likely to support the reasonableness of an expectation of privacy [147-156].Issue 3: Whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to uphold the findings of the first instance judge.This ground of appeal was dependent upon Bloomberg establishing that the Court of Appeal erred in law on Issue 1 and/or Issue 2, which it has not done. Therefore, there are no grounds for intervening with the judge’s decision in relation to the balancing exercise [157].References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court’s decision.

Each carried a flag of the Kurdistan Workers Party (\"the PKK\"), an organisation which is proscribed under the 2000 Act. The appellants were each convicted in Westminster Magistrates’ Court of a section 13(1) offence. The Crown Court dismissed their appeals, holding that section 13(1) created an offence of strict liability meaning that the offence did not require a person to have any knowledge of the import of the article that he or she was wearing, carrying or displaying, or of its capacity to arouse reasonable suspicion that he or she was a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation. The Crown Court also held that section 13(1) was not incompatible with the right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (\"the Convention\").Two issues arise on this appeal. First, whether section 13(1) creates an offence of strict liability. Second, if it does, whether it is incompatible with article 10 of the Convention.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lady Arden, Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows deliver a joint judgment, with which Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lady Rose agree.Reasons for the JudgmentStrict liabilitySection 13(1) is a strict liability offence. A limited mental element is required under section 13(1) in that the defendant must know that he or she is wearing or carrying or displaying the relevant article[26]. However, there is no extra mental element required over and above this[58].There is a strong presumption that criminal offences require mens rea[27]-[33]. In this case, the presumption is rebutted by necessary implication[34]-[35]. First, the words arousing \"reasonable suspicion\" impose an objective standard and indicate that there is no requirement of mens rea[36]-[41]. Second, to interpret section 13(1) as requiring mens rea would render incoherent what can otherwise be viewed as a calibrated and rational scheme of proscribed organisation offences in the 2000 Act[42]-[53]. Third, a strict liability interpretation of the offence in section 13(1) is supported by the purpose (or mischief or policy) behind the offence, which is concerned with the effect on other people rather than the intention or knowledge of the defendant[54]-[56].Compatibility with article 10 of the ConventionThe offence under section 13(1) is compatible with article 10. Section 13 is an interference for the purposes of article 10(1)[60]. However, that interference is justified [77]. First, the restriction is prescribed by law, in that section 13(1) is expressed in clear terms which provide legal certainty[63]. Second, the restriction pursues legitimate aims, in that it is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, the prevention of disorder and crime and the protection of the rights of others[64]. Third, the restriction is necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. Even taking into account the European Court of Human Rights’ (\"ECtHR\") jurisprudence that, under article 10, necessity is not to be lightly found, section 13 strikes a fair balance between the right to freedom of expression and the need to protect society by preventing terrorism. In particular, the offence is circumscribed by the requirement for reasonable suspicion and the sanctions are comparatively minor[68]. The Supreme Court rejects the appellants’ submission that the ECtHR considers that expressive acts can only be criminalised where the expression includes an incitement to violence[73]-[77].References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court’s decision.

However, there is no extra mental element required over and above this[58].There is a strong presumption that criminal offences require mens rea[27]-[33]. In this case, the presumption is rebutted by necessary implication[34]-[35]. First, the words arousing \"reasonable suspicion\" impose an objective standard and indicate that there is no requirement of mens rea[36]-[41]. Second, to interpret section 13(1) as requiring mens rea would render incoherent what can otherwise be viewed as a calibrated and rational scheme of proscribed organisation offences in the 2000 Act[42]-[53]. Third, a strict liability interpretation of the offence in section 13(1) is supported by the purpose (or mischief or policy) behind the offence, which is concerned with the effect on other people rather than the intention or knowledge of the defendant[54]-[56].Compatibility with article 10 of the ConventionThe offence under section 13(1) is compatible with article 10. Section 13 is an interference for the purposes of article 10(1)[60]. However, that interference is justified [77]. First, the restriction is prescribed by law, in that section 13(1) is expressed in clear terms which provide legal certainty[63]. Second, the restriction pursues legitimate aims, in that it is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, the prevention of disorder and crime and the protection of the rights of others[64]. Third, the restriction is necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. Even taking into account the European Court of Human Rights’ (\"ECtHR\") jurisprudence that, under article 10, necessity is not to be lightly found, section 13 strikes a fair balance between the right to freedom of expression and the need to protect society by preventing terrorism. In particular, the offence is circumscribed by the requirement for reasonable suspicion and the sanctions are comparatively minor[68]. The Supreme Court rejects the appellants’ submission that the ECtHR considers that expressive acts can only be criminalised where the expression includes an incitement to violence[73]-[77].References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court’s decision.

She has Nigerian citizenship, but from her tenth birthday she has satisfied the requirements to apply for registration as a British citizen under section 1(4) of the British Nationality Act 1981 (the \"1981 Act\"). O applied to be registered as a British citizen on 15 December 2017 but was unable to afford the full amount of the fee, which was £973 at that time [2]. It was not disputed that many children and their families cannot afford the fee charged where an applicant is a child [20]. Because the full fee was not paid, the Secretary of State refused to process O’s application [2]. O is joined in her challenge by The Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens [4].The Immigration Act 2014 (the \"2014 Act\") empowers the Secretary of State to set the fees for applications to obtain British citizenship in subordinate legislation, having regard only to the matters listed in section 68(9) of the 2014 Act. Those matters include not only the cost of processing the application but also the benefits that are likely to accrue from obtaining British citizenship and the costs of exercising other functions in relation to immigration and nationality [9-17]. The current level of the fee produces a substantial surplus, over the administrative cost of processing an application to be applied, to subsidise other parts of the immigration and nationality system [3].The appellants challenge the level of the registration fee on the basis that the Secretary of State did not have the power to set the fee at a level which rendered nugatory the underlying statutory right to become a British citizen conferred by the 1981 Act [20-21].JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Hodge gives the lead judgment, with whom Lord Briggs, Lord Stephens and Lady Rose agree. Lady Arden gives a concurring judgment.Reasons for the JudgmentLord Hodge explains that the issue on this appeal is one of statutory interpretation: whether Parliament has authorised in primary legislation the imposition by subordinate legislation of the challenged fee [27].Lord Hodge begins by explaining the process of statutory interpretation. By statutory interpretation, the courts are seeking the meaning of the words which Parliament used. Words and passages in a statute derive their meaning from their context. Other provisions in the statute and the statute as a whole may provide the relevant internal context. They are the words which Parliament has chosen to enact as an expression of the purpose of the legislation and are therefore the primary source by which meaning is ascertained [29]. An important constitutional reason for having regard primarily to the statutory context is that citizens should be able to rely upon what they read in an Act of Parliament [29]. External aids, such as explanatory notes, Law Commission reports, and Government White Papers, must therefore play a secondary role. External aids may assist in identifying the background to a statute, the issue it addresses and its purpose, and the context they disclose may assist in ascertaining the meaning of the statute. But they do not displace the meanings of the words of a statute which are clear and unambiguous in their wider context and which do not produce absurdity [30]. In summary, statutory interpretation involves an objective assessment of the meaning which a reasonable legislature as a body would be seeking to convey in using the statutory words which are being considered [31].Lord Hodge then turns to the appellants’ submissions. He notes that the appeal is not concerned with fundamental or constitutional common law rights, nor are any Convention rights under the Human Rights Act 1998 engaged [33]. The special rules of construction that are applicable when the principle of legality is infringed or the constitutional right of access to the courts is intruded upon therefore do not apply [33]. The appellants’ argument based on the constitutional right of access to the courts therefore has no application to the present case [36].The appellants also argued that specific statutory rights are not to be cut down by subordinate legislation passed under the vires of a different Act, a rule identified in the case of R v Secretary of State for Social Security, Ex p Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants [1997] 1 WLR 275 (\"JCWI\") [34]. Lord Hodge explains that an earlier statute (\"statute 1\") can be expressly or impliedly amended or repealed by Parliament enacting a later statute (\"statute 2\"), including by empowering the executive branch of government to make subordinate legislation which impinges upon and even removes rights conferred by statute 1 [40]. Where statute 2 authorises subordinate legislation, the court’s task is to ascertain the scope of the enabling power contained in statute 2 [40]. In doing so the court will take into account assumptions or presumptions such as the principle of legality [41]. If the court concludes that statute 2 has empowered the executive to make subordinate legislation which has the effect of removing rights conferred by statute 1, the rule inJCWIidentified by the appellants imposes no additional hurdle [42]. And where the court is not dealing with an interference by statute with a common law constitutional right or with a statutory provision which declares such a fundamental or constitutional right, the normal rules of statutory interpretation apply [43].Applying those principles, Lord Hodge concludes that, in the 2014 Act, Parliament authorised the subordinate legislation by which the Secretary of State has fixed the relevant application fee [51]. The appropriateness of imposing the fee on children is a question of policy which is for political determination, and not a matter for the court. The appeal is therefore dismissed [52].Lady Arden agrees with Lord Hodge but explains that she considers there is a wider role in statutory interpretation for pre-legislative materials [58]. Lady Arden observes that the constitutional reason Lord Hodge gives for the courts not using explanatory notes no longer applies insofar as explanatory notes are now often published by commercial publishers and appear online free of charge [59-60]. Lady Arden also considers that there are occasions when pre-legislative material may go further than simply provide the background or context for the statutory provision in question [64-65]. In appropriate circumstances such materials can also considerably help the judge better to perform his or her role of finding the intention of Parliament in any particular enactment, for example when such materials reveal that the language of the statute – perhaps thought to be clear on its face – is in fact ambiguous [66-76].References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court’s decision.

The flats in Settlers Court are held under long leaseholds. The lessees under such long leaseholds are granted the \"right to manage\" (the \"RTM\") by Part 2, Chapter 1 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (the \"2002 Act\"). The RTM permits them to take over management of the block of which their flats form part from the existing manager, whether the landlord or a third party, via a single purpose company (the \"RTM Company\"). The RTM Company formed by the lessees of the flats in Settlers Court obtained the RTM in respect of Settlers Court on 8 November 2014. That RTM Company is the First Respondent to the appeal. The other Respondents are lessees of flats in Settlers Court.The Estate contains other blocks of flats beyond Settlers Court. These other blocks share facilities and amenities with Settlers Court (the \"Estate Facilities\"). Prior to the lessees of Settlers Court exercising the RTM, the service of managing the Estate Facilities (the \"Estate Services\") was provided by a third party manager, the Appellant, for the benefit of the entire Estate. Under the terms of the relevant leases, the Appellant was entitled to levy charges from the lessees on the Estate in respect of providing the Estate Services (the \"Estate Charges\").A dispute arose between the parties over the extent of the RTM exercised by the lessees of Settlers Court. The Respondents claimed that the statutory RTM extends beyond Settlers Court so as to include the Estate Facilities. These were said to form part of the \"premises\" over which the RTM is exercisable. Consequently, the RTM Company, not the Appellant, was now responsible for providing the Estate Services to the lessees of Settlers Court and the Appellant was no longer entitled to levy the Estate Charges from them. Instead, once the RTM had been exercised, the Estate Charges in respect of Settlers Court, some 15.2% of the total for the Estate, became payable to the RTM Company not the Appellant.The Appellant disputed this, maintaining that it remained exclusively responsible for providing the Estate Services to the entire Estate because the RTM does not extend beyond the block over which it is exercised (and facilities and amenities solely relating to it). As such, it claimed to be entitled to continue to levy the Estate Charges from the lessees of Settlers Court, noting that it alone continued to provide the Estate Services to the entire Estate pursuant to its obligations under the long leases of flats in blocks other than Settlers Court, which remained in force on any view, and incurred the full costs of doing so.The parties were unable to reach agreement as to how the Estate Facilities should be managed and the Estate Charges levied. On 8 December 2017, the Appellant therefore applied to the First-tier Tribunal (the \"F-tT\") to determine whether it was entitled to levy Estate Charges from the lessees of the flats in Settlers Court. The F-tT found against the Appellant, considering itself bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal inGala Unity Ltd v Ariadne RoadRTM Co Ltd [2012] EWCA Civ 1372. In that case, the Court of Appeal had decided that the RTM did extend to facilities on an estate which were shared between the block of flats over which the RTM had been exercised and other dwellings, even though this would potentially leave both the RTM Company and the pre-existing manager responsible to different groups of lessees for providing the same services simultaneously. The Upper Tribunal (the \"UT\") dismissed the Appellant’s appeal on the basis that, amongst other things, it too was bound byGala Unity. The UT did however issue a leapfrog certificate for an appeal directly to the Supreme Court. This was the first time that the UT has issued such a certificate.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and, in doing so, holds that Gala Unity was wrongly decided. Lord Briggs gives the sole judgment with which all other members of the Court agree.Reasons for the JudgmentThe RTM grants the RTM Company the right to perform the relevant management functions over \"the premises\" to the exclusion of any other person such as the existing manager. Treating it as applying to shared common facilities raised insuperable problems [36]. The lessees of flats in blocks other than that over which the RTM has been exercised would be effectively disenfranchised by having shared Estate Services provided by an RTM Company with which they had no formal legal relationship. This would also be contrary to the terms of their leases and was the opposite of what the RTM under the 2002 Act was supposed to achieve[37]-[38].The statutory language in the 2002 Act, which had to be construed in light of the context and purpose of the Act, included numerous signposts pointing against the Estate Facilities forming part of the \"premises\" over which the RTM was exercisable. As such, the RTM could not grant the RTM Company the right or obligation to provide the Estate Services[39]-[49]. That construction of the 2002 Act was confirmed, but no more than that, by the Consultation Paper which accompanied the draft bill which later became the 2002 Act. This was admissible[51]-[53]. The particular facts ofGala Unityhad served to obscure the real difficulties created by the Court of Appeal’s decision in that case and the existence of overlapping rights to provide the Estate Services between a manager and an RTM Company[50].The scope of the RTM contended for by the Respondents would lead to outcomes, such as on the facts of the present case, which were both absurd and unworkable. The court would therefore lean against such a construction of the 2002 Act[54]. If the RTM Company was responsible for the Estate Services, it would be entitled to recover Estate Charges only from the lessees of the building in respect of which it had been set up. In this case that would mean only some 15% of the costs of providing the Estate Services could be recovered by the RTM Company. This would likely pose insurmountable solvency issues for it. Conversely, if the existing manager retained responsibility for providing the Estate Services, as it was bound to do under the terms of the leases held by the lessees of buildings other than that over which the RTM had been exercised, it could not recover the costs of doing so from the lessees who had exercised the RTM. In this case, that meant that, absent some agreement with the RTM Company, the Appellant, as manager, could recover only 85% of the costs of providing the Estate Services to the Estate as a whole[56]-[57]. Whilst in some cases the RTM Company and the manager might reach agreement, there was no obligation on an RTM company to do so. It was obviously preferable to interpret the 2002 Act in a way which did not lead to an unworkable situation absent such agreement[58].The RTM under the 2002 Act does not therefore extend to the RTM Company managing the shared Estate Facilities, which do not form part of the \"premises\" over which the RTM is exercisable. The Appellant remains the sole party responsible for providing the Estate Services to all lessees on the Estate and entitled to levy Estate Charges accordingly, including from the lessees of flats in Settlers Court[62].Gala Unitywas wrongly decided and should be overruled[63]. The appeal is therefore allowed.References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court’s decision.

On that day, the Respondent’s solicitor stated orally in court that an appeal would be lodged against the extradition order, and on 16 December 2015, the notice of application for leave to appeal was filed with the Court. However, due to an oversight, the solicitor failed to serve the notice on the Crown Solicitor’s Office (on behalf of Greece) until about three weeks later.Section 26(5) of the Extradition Act 2003 provides that where a person gives notice of application for leave to appeal against an extradition order after the end of the permitted period (which is seven days from the date of the relevant order), the High Court must not for that reason refuse to entertain the application if the person did \"everything reasonably possible to ensure that the notice was given as soon as it could be given.\"The Divisional Court in England and Wales inSzegfu v Court of Pecs, Hungary[2015] EWHC 1764 (Admin) had indicated that the correct interpretation of section 26(5) permitted no distinction between the conduct of the person and the conduct of their legal representative, so that the legal representative’s conduct was to be attributed to the person with the consequence that if the legal representative had not done everything reasonably possible to ensure that the notice was given as soon as it could be given, the High Court should not entertain the application for leave to appeal. In this case, the Divisional Court in Northern Ireland disagreed with the interpretation inSzegfuand found that it was not necessary to hold a person responsible for any failings on the part of his legal representatives. The Divisional Court in Northern Ireland decided to entertain Mr O’Connor’s application for leave to appeal, notwithstanding that it was made out of time. The Appellant now appeals that decision.The question for the Supreme Court to decide is whether section 26(5) should be interpreted to allow or exclude a distinction between the actions of a person and their legal representative.JudgmentThe Supreme Court dismisses the appeal. Lord Stephens gives the judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.Reasons for the JudgmentSection 26(1) of the Extradition Act 2003 identifies a \"person\" as being the person who is subject to an extradition order. In section 26(5), the word \"person\" appears twice. Lord Stephens finds that on both occurrences, \"person\" means the person subject to an extradition order, as set out in section 26(1). In the second occurrence of the word, the requirement of doing everything reasonably possible is imposed by the language of the provision only on \"the person\" and there is no evident reason to understand it as also being imposed on the individual’s agent or legal representative. [48]This interpretation is supported by considering the vice sought to be addressed by Parliament when inserting section 26(5) into the Extradition Act 2003. The vice was the potential for substantial injustice caused by the application of short and rigid time limits for those seeking to appeal against extradition orders, whether or not such persons had legal representation. [49]The surrogacy principle involves the imputation of the fault of a client’s legal representative to that client. However, the surrogacy principle is not universal. Lord Stephens finds that the surrogacy principle does not require an interpretation of section 26(5) consistent with the Divisional Court’s view inSzegfu. [50]Lord Stephens agrees with the Divisional Court in this case, in finding that the procedural unfairness of attributing the fault of the legal representative to the client may not be remedied in practice, because even if it is open to the client to sue his legal representative in negligence, that right will not be of little assistance in circumstances where the client has been extradited to a place where he is at risk of inhuman and degrading treatment. [51]Accordingly, Lord Stephens departs from the interpretation of section 26(5) inSzegfu[52], and dismisses the Appellant’s appeal.

       "  'content': '\\uf0b7  Lord Walker made clear that the scope of the appeal was limited – the court did not have the task of deciding whether or not the system of charging current account customers was fair, but whether  the  OFT  could  challenge  the  charges  as  being  excessive  in  relation  to  the  services supplied in exchange (Paragraph 3). As Lord Phillips stated, even if such a challenge was not possible, it might still be open for the OFT to assess the fairness of the charges according to other criteria (Para 61). \\uf0b7  The key issue was whether the charges constituted the ‘price and remuneration’ as against ‘the goods or services supplied in exchange’ within the meaning of the Regulations. The Supreme Court considered and decided a number of arguments as to whether the charges could be said to be ‘price or remuneration’ under Regulation 6 (2) (b): (1)  The  charges  were  not  paid  ‘in  exchange’  for  the  transactions  to  which  they  related  –  eg. honouring a cheque when the customer had insufficient funds to do so (Para 75). (2)  The Court of Appeal was wrong to find that Regulation 6 (2) (b) did not apply to charges that were ‘ancillary’ to the core contract between the bank and customer (Paras 38-41, 47, 78, 112). Lord  Walker  commented  that  Regulation  6  (2)  (b)  contained  no  indication  that  only  the ‘essential’  price  or  remuneration  was  relevant.  In  fact,  any  monetary  price  or  remuneration payable  under  the  contract  would  naturally  fall  within  the  language  of  Regulation    6  (2)  (b) (Para 41). (3)  The  charges  were  not  concealed  default  charges  designed  to  discourage  customers  from becoming overdrawn on their accounts without prior arrangement (Paras 88, 114). The High Court had rejected this argument and was right to do so. (4)  The charges were properly to be regarded as falling within the scope of the Regulations (Paras 43,  80,  104).  They  were  in  fact  part  of  the  price  or  remuneration  paid  by  the  customer  in exchange  for  the  package  of  services  which  made  up  a  current  account  (Paras  47,  89).  The fact  that  liability  to  pay  the  charges  depended  on  specific  events  occurring  was  irrelevant  to that conclusion (Paras 47, 104). \\uf0b7  Accordingly,  since  any  assessment  of  the  fairness  of  the  charges,    which  related  to  their appropriateness as against the services supplied in exchange, fell within Regulation 6 (2) (b), no such assessment could take place and so the appeal would be allowed (Paras 51, 90, 92, 118, 119).  Further Comments \\uf0b7  Lord  Phillips  also  noted  that  in  the  absence  of  the  charges  the  banks  would  not  be  able profitably to provide current account services without a fee (Para 88). He stated that it might be  open  to  question  whether  it  is  fair  to  subsidise  some  customers  whose  accounts  always remain  in  credit  by  levies  on  others  who  experienced  events  they  did  not  foresee  when  they opened their accounts (Para 80). \\uf0b7  Lord Walker commented that ministers and Parliament had decided to transpose the directive as  it  stood  rather  than  to  confer  the  higher  degree  of  consumer  protection  afforded  by  the national  laws  of  some  other  member  states.  Parliament  might  wish  to  consider  whether  to revisit that decision (Para 52). Lord Mance endorsed this comment (Para 118).

She questioned whether the real problem was not the charging model, but the lack of competition between the banks as to the product they offered (Para 93).   No Reference to European Court of Justice \\uf0b7  The  court  decided  that  although  the  interpretation  of  the  European  directive  which  the Regulations  implemented  was  a  question  of  European  law  it  was  not  necessary  to  refer  the matter to the European Court of Justice (Paras 49, 91, 115, 120).

       "  'content': '\\uf0b7  Lord Hope considered the phrase “an asylum claim, or a human rights claim” in s 92(4)(a) in the context of the 2002 Act as a whole and rejected the Appellant’s argument that the Supreme Court should follow the interpretation in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Onibiyo [1996] QB  768.  In Onibiyo,  “claim”  in  the  context  of  the  1993  Act was  held  to  mean  a  first  claim,  or  a second or subsequent claim which has been accepted as a “fresh claim” by the Secretary of State, but  not  a  claim  which  is  repetitious.  Lord  Hope  determined  that  whilst  the  2002  Act  uses substantially the same words as the 1993 Act, the statutory system is markedly different given the The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  Parliament Square London SW1P 3BD T: 020 7960 1886/1887 F: 020 7960 1901 www.supremecourt.gov.uk   \\x0c\\uf0b7 addition of a range of powers enabling the Secretary of State or immigration officer to deal with repetitious  claims.  No  inference  was  drawn  from  the  amendment  of  s  113  by  s  12  of  the Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006  as  it  is  not  yet  in  force.  (Paras  [25]-[29];  [44]–[46]) In a case such as this where no certification has been given under s 94 (providing for the exclusion of appeals that are clearly unfounded) or s 96 (removing the right of appeal if the claim raises an issue  which  has  been  or  ought  to  have  been  dealt  with  in  an  earlier  appeal),  there  is  no  need  to impose a further requirement which is not mentioned elsewhere in the 2002 Act, namely that the words “a…claim”  exclude a further  claim which has not been held under rule 353 to be a fresh claim. (Para [29]) \\uf0b7  The Appellant’s construction risks undermining the beneficial objects of the Refugee Convention, as it would exclude, by s 95, claims which the Secretary of State considers not to be fresh claims from  the  ground  of  appeal  in  s  84(1)(g),  when  claims  which  are  certified  as  clearly  unfounded under s 94 would still be given the benefit of that section. (Section 84(1)(g) provides for an appeal where  removal  would  place  the  UK  in  breach  of  its  international  or  human  rights  obligations.) (Paras [30]–[32]; [47]) \\uf0b7  Rule 353 does not affect the operation of the legislative scheme, which provides the complete code for dealing with repeat claims. (Para [33])  Lady Hale, dissenting, would have allowed the appeal. \\uf0b7  Lady Hale concluded “a…claim” in s 92(4)(a) of the 2002 Act ought to be given the same meaning ascribed  to the phrase in the 1993 Act  in  Onibiyo. There was no need for it to be defined in the 2002  Act  given  it  had  already  been  judicially  interpreted.  (Paras  [39]–[40])  The  addition  of sections 94 and 96 should not be taken to mean that Parliament had abandoned the old meaning of “claim” without expressly saying so, particularly as the additional sections are not apt to cater for repetitious claims. (Paras [41]–[42]) \\uf0b7  Lady  Hale  disagreed  that  the  Appellant’s  construction  would  undermine  the  UK’s  international obligations. A person who presents a repeat claim on asylum or human rights grounds has already enjoyed the right of appeal on these grounds within this country. The current system allowing for an  initial  decision  followed  by  an  appeal  system  in  the  UK  is  sufficient  compliance  with  those obligations.
