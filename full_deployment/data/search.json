In May 2017, the US Government made a request for his extradition to the US, where he is accused of committing an offence relating to securities fraud.The process for determining whether a person should be extradited from the UK is governed by the Extradition Act 2003 (\\\"the 2003 Act\\\"). By the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (\\\"the 2013 Act\\\"), Parliament inserted into the 2003 Act a number of provisions referred to as \\\"the forum bar provisions\\\". These provisions aim to prevent extradition where the offences could be fairly and effectively tried in the UK, and it is not in the interests of justice that the requested person should be extradited. Section 61 of the 2013 Act provides that the forum bar provisions will \\\"come into force on such a day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint\\\". The Secretary of State brought the forum bar provisions into force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in October 2013, but he did not bring them into force in Scotland.Mr Craig wanted to rely on the forum bar provisions in the extradition proceedings brought against him in Scotland. He therefore issued a claim against the Advocate General for Scotland and the Scottish Ministers, arguing that the Secretary of State\\u2019s failure to bring the forum bar provisions into force in Scotland was unlawful. In December 2018, the Outer House of the Court of Session found in Mr Craig\\u2019s favour and made an order in which it \\\"declared\\u2026 that in its continuing failure to bring into force in Scotland the extradition forum bar provisions\\u2026 the UK Government is acting unlawfully and contrary to its duties under section 61 of [the 2013 Act]\\\".Notwithstanding that order, the UK Government failed to bring the forum bar provisions into force in Scotland until September 2021. In the meantime, the Lord Advocate continued to pursue extradition proceedings against Mr Craig. In July 2019, a sheriff decided that there was no bar to Mr Craig\\u2019s extradition under the 2003 Act and that his extradition would be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (\\\"the Convention\\\"). The sheriff sent the matter on to the Scottish Ministers, who in September 2019 decided that Mr Craig should be extradited to the US.Mr Craig appealed, unsuccessfully, to the High Court of Justiciary. He now appeals to the Supreme Court.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. A new extradition hearing may be held before a different sheriff, at which Mr Craig will be able to rely on the forum bar provisions (in addition to any other arguments properly available to him).Lord Reed gives the sole judgment, with which the other Justices agree.Reasons for the JudgmentSection 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998 provides that a \\\"member of the Scottish Government has no power to\\u2026 act, so far as the\\u2026 act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights\\\"[25]. This means that the Lord Advocate has no power to conduct extradition proceedings against Mr Craig, and the Scottish Ministers have no power to order his extradition, if those acts are incompatible with Mr Craig\\u2019s rights under the Convention[37], [47].There is no dispute that the extradition of Mr Craig would interfere with his right to respect for his private and family life, as guaranteed by article 8(1) of the Convention. Such an interference could, however, be justified under article 8(2), if it is \\\"in accordance with the law\\\", if it pursues a \\\"legitimate aim\\\", and if it is \\\"necessary in a democratic society\\\". To satisfy the first of those three requirements, the interference must be in conformity with domestic law and the domestic law must meet the requirements of the rule of law, so as to afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness. This is an absolute requirement. The executive is afforded no margin of discretion in meeting it[48]-[50].The interference with Mr Craig\\u2019s rights under article 8(1) was not \\\"in accordance with the law\\\", within the meaning of article 8(2)[52]. The order made by the Outer House in December 2018 was expressed in the present tense, making clear that the Secretary of State was \\\"continuing\\\" to act in breach of section 61 of the 2013 Act by failing to bring the forum bar provisions into force. The Secretary of State had a duty to act in conformity with that order, and his failure to do so was unlawful[41]-[42]. The extradition procedure followed in Mr Craig\\u2019s case did not therefore accord with section 61 of the 2013 Act[52].It is no answer to this that the order made by the Outer House was merely declaratory, rather than coercive[43]. It is firmly established that there is a clear expectation that the Government will comply with declaratory orders, and it is in reliance on that expectation that the courts usually refrain from making coercive orders against the Government and grant declaratory orders instead[44]. This is one of the core principles of our constitution. It is vital to the mutual trust which underpins the relationship between the Government and the courts[46].Accordingly, the extradition proceedings against Mr Craig were not conducted \\\"in accordance with the law\\\" and so were incompatible with his rights under article 8 of the Convention. It follows that the extradition order made against him is invalid[53].References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court\\u2019s decision.

He and his employer were the subject of a criminal investigation by a UK Legal Enforcement Body (the \\\"UKLEB\\\"). During that investigation, the UKLEB sent a confidential Letter of Request (the \\\"Letter\\\") to the authorities of a foreign state seeking, among other things, information and documents relating to ZXC. The Letter expressly requested that its existence and contents remain confidential.The Appellant (\\\"Bloomberg\\\"), a well-known media company, obtained a copy of the Letter, on the basis of which it published an article reporting that information had been requested in respect of ZXC and detailing the matters in respect of which he was being investigated. After Bloomberg refused to remove the article from its website, and following an unsuccessful application for an interim injunction, ZXC brought a successful claim against Bloomberg for misuse of private information.ZXC claimed that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to: (1) the fact that the UKLEB had requested information relating to him in the context of its investigations, and (2) the details of the matters that the UKLEB was investigating in relation to him. The first instance judge held that Bloomberg had published private information that was in principle protected by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the \\\"ECHR\\\"); and that in balancing ZXC\\u2019s rights against those of Bloomberg under article 10 ECHR, the balance favoured ZXC. Bloomberg\\u2019s appeal against that judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Bloomberg now appeals to the Supreme Court.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. It holds that, in general, a person under criminal investigation has, prior to being charged, a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information relating to that investigation. Lord Hamblen and Lord Stephens give the sole joint judgment, with which the other Justices agree.Reasons for the JudgmentAs is now well established, and was common ground, misuse of private information is a distinct tort where liability is determined by applying a two-stage test. Stage one is whether the claimant objectively has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the relevant information considering all the circumstances of the case. Such circumstances are likely to include, but are not limited to, those identified in the Court of Appeal\\u2019s decision in Murray v Express Newspapers plc [2008] EWCA Civ 446 at para 36 (the so-called \\\"Murray factors\\\") [48-55]. If so, stage two is whether that expectation is outweighed by the publisher\\u2019s right to freedom of expression. This involves a balancing exercise between the claimant\\u2019s article 8 ECHR right to privacy and the publisher\\u2019s article 10 ECHR right to freedom of expression, having due regard to section 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998 [56-62].Issue 1: The stage one test and whether the Court of Appeal was correct to hold that there is a general rule, applicable in the present case, that a person under criminal investigation has, prior to being charged, a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information relating to that investigation.It is widely accepted as a matter of public policy that there is a negative effect on an innocent person\\u2019s reputation in publishing that he or she is being investigated by the police or another state organisation. There is a uniform general practice by state investigatory bodies not to identify those under investigation prior to charge [80-89]. Additionally, several first instance judgments have accepted the private nature of such information based on the potential that its publication would ordinarily cause substantial damage to the person\\u2019s reputation, and other damage [90-99].Bloomberg advanced four arguments challenging the general rule or legitimate starting point in relation to this category of information, all of which the court rejects [74].First, Bloomberg submitted that given the public\\u2019s ability to observe the presumption of innocence, the application of a general rule or legitimate starting point is unsound because it overstates the extent to which publishing the information will cause damage to the claimant\\u2019s reputation. The presumption of innocence is a legal presumption applicable to criminal trials. But in this different context, the question is how others, including a person\\u2019s inner circle, will react to the publication of information that that person is under criminal investigation. It is undeniable that a person\\u2019s reputation will ordinarily be adversely affected, impacting their right to respect for private life such as the right to establish and develop relationships with other people [100-109].Second, Bloomberg argued that the courts\\u2019 reliance below on the \\\"human characteristic\\\" to equate suspicion or investigation with guilt on the assumption that there is \\\"no smoke without fire\\\" runs contrary to well-established principles in defamation law such that the ordinary reasonable reader can distinguish suspicion from guilt and is not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. But ZXC did not bring a claim in defamation. The tort of misuse of private information is a separate tort with different constituent elements and a distinct purpose. Unlike in defamation, the purpose of the tort of misuse of private information is not only to protect an individual from the publication of untrue information. Rather, its purpose is to protect an individual\\u2019s private life in accordance with article 8 ECHR, regardless of the truth or falsity of the information, and it is therefore inappropriate to read across concepts from the tort of defamation [110-113].Third, Bloomberg submitted that information should not be protected because it\\u2019s reputationally damaging but rather because it belongs to a part of the claimant\\u2019s life which is of no-one else\\u2019s concern and that does not include ZXC\\u2019s business activities. This is an unduly restrictive view of the protection afforded by article 8 ECHR, which can include professional or business activities. A person\\u2019s reputation is within the scope of their article 8 ECHR \\\"private life\\\" provided the attack on reputation attains a certain level of seriousness and prejudices a person\\u2019s right to respect for private life [114-125].Fourth, Bloomberg argued the courts below failed to apply the correct legal test at stage one, involving a consideration of \\\"all the circumstances of the case\\\", which should have included the activity in which ZXC was engaged, namely \\\"alleged corruption in relation to ZXC\\u2019s company\\u2019s activities in a foreign country\\\". The nature of the activity in which ZXC was engaged is not a factor of particular significance here. The courts below gave due consideration to the applicable Murray factors in their multi-factorial analysis, including ZXC\\u2019s status as a businessman involved in the affairs of a large public company. Whilst ZXC\\u2019s status might mean that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider than for a private individual, there is a limit. The factor is not in itself determinative and should only form part of the stage one analysis [126-143].Therefore, the courts below were correct to hold that, as a legitimate starting point, a person under criminal investigation has, prior to being charged, a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information relating to that investigation and that in all the circumstances this is a case in which that applies and there is such an expectation [144-145].Issue 2: Whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to hold that, in a case in which a claim for breach of confidence was not pursued, the fact that Bloomberg published information originating from a confidential law enforcement document rendered the information private and/or undermined Bloomberg\\u2019s ability to rely on the public interest in its disclosure.The judge was right to treat the Letter\\u2019s confidentiality as a relevant and important factor at both stage one and stage two but neither the judge nor the Court of Appeal held that the Letter\\u2019s confidentiality itself rendered the information private or prevented Bloomberg from relying on the public interest on its disclosure. Whilst there is no necessary overlap between the distinct actions for misuse of private information and for breach of confidence, confidentiality and privacy will often overlap, and if information is confidential that is likely to support the reasonableness of an expectation of privacy [147-156].Issue 3: Whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to uphold the findings of the first instance judge.This ground of appeal was dependent upon Bloomberg establishing that the Court of Appeal erred in law on Issue 1 and/or Issue 2, which it has not done. Therefore, there are no grounds for intervening with the judge\\u2019s decision in relation to the balancing exercise [157].References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court\\u2019s decision.

Each carried a flag of the Kurdistan Workers Party (\\\"the PKK\\\"), an organisation which is proscribed under the 2000 Act. The appellants were each convicted in Westminster Magistrates\\u2019 Court of a section 13(1) offence. The Crown Court dismissed their appeals, holding that section 13(1) created an offence of strict liability meaning that the offence did not require a person to have any knowledge of the import of the article that he or she was wearing, carrying or displaying, or of its capacity to arouse reasonable suspicion that he or she was a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation. The Crown Court also held that section 13(1) was not incompatible with the right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (\\\"the Convention\\\").Two issues arise on this appeal. First, whether section 13(1) creates an offence of strict liability. Second, if it does, whether it is incompatible with article 10 of the Convention.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lady Arden, Lord Hamblen and Lord Burrows deliver a joint judgment, with which Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lady Rose agree.Reasons for the JudgmentStrict liabilitySection 13(1) is a strict liability offence. A limited mental element is required under section 13(1) in that the defendant must know that he or she is wearing or carrying or displaying the relevant article[26]. However, there is no extra mental element required over and above this[58].There is a strong presumption that criminal offences require mens rea[27]-[33]. In this case, the presumption is rebutted by necessary implication[34]-[35]. First, the words arousing \\\"reasonable suspicion\\\" impose an objective standard and indicate that there is no requirement of mens rea[36]-[41]. Second, to interpret section 13(1) as requiring mens rea would render incoherent what can otherwise be viewed as a calibrated and rational scheme of proscribed organisation offences in the 2000 Act[42]-[53]. Third, a strict liability interpretation of the offence in section 13(1) is supported by the purpose (or mischief or policy) behind the offence, which is concerned with the effect on other people rather than the intention or knowledge of the defendant[54]-[56].Compatibility with article 10 of the ConventionThe offence under section 13(1) is compatible with article 10. Section 13 is an interference for the purposes of article 10(1)[60]. However, that interference is justified [77]. First, the restriction is prescribed by law, in that section 13(1) is expressed in clear terms which provide legal certainty[63]. Second, the restriction pursues legitimate aims, in that it is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, the prevention of disorder and crime and the protection of the rights of others[64]. Third, the restriction is necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. Even taking into account the European Court of Human Rights\\u2019 (\\\"ECtHR\\\") jurisprudence that, under article 10, necessity is not to be lightly found, section 13 strikes a fair balance between the right to freedom of expression and the need to protect society by preventing terrorism. In particular, the offence is circumscribed by the requirement for reasonable suspicion and the sanctions are comparatively minor[68]. The Supreme Court rejects the appellants\\u2019 submission that the ECtHR considers that expressive acts can only be criminalised where the expression includes an incitement to violence[73]-[77].References in square brackets are to paragraphs in the judgmentNoteThis summary is provided to assist in understanding the Court\\u2019s decision.

She has Nigerian citizenship, but from her tenth birthday she has satisfied the requirements to apply for registration as a British citizen under section 1(4) of the British Nationality Act 1981 (the \\\"1981 Act\\\"). O applied to be registered as a British citizen on 15 December 2017 but was unable to afford the full amount of the fee, which was \\u00a3973 at that time [2]. It was not disputed that many children and their families cannot afford the fee charged where an applicant is a child [20]. Because the full fee was not paid, the Secretary of State refused to process O\\u2019s application [2]. O is joined in her challenge by The Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens [4].The Immigration Act 2014 (the \\\"2014 Act\\\") empowers the Secretary of State to set the fees for applications to obtain British citizenship in subordinate legislation, having regard only to the matters listed in section 68(9) of the 2014 Act. Those matters include not only the cost of processing the application but also the benefits that are likely to accrue from obtaining British citizenship and the costs of exercising other functions in relation to immigration and nationality [9-17]. The current level of the fee produces a substantial surplus, over the administrative cost of processing an application to be applied, to subsidise other parts of the immigration and nationality system [3].The appellants challenge the level of the registration fee on the basis that the Secretary of State did not have the power to set the fee at a level which rendered nugatory the underlying statutory right to become a British citizen conferred by the 1981 Act [20-21].JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Hodge gives the lead judgment, with whom Lord Briggs, Lord Stephens and Lady Rose agree. Lady Arden gives a concurring judgment.Reasons for the JudgmentLord Hodge explains that the issue on this appeal is one of statutory interpretation: whether Parliament has authorised in primary legislation the imposition by subordinate legislation of the challenged fee [27].Lord Hodge begins by explaining the process of statutory interpretation. By statutory interpretation, the courts are seeking the meaning of the words which Parliament used. Words and passages in a statute derive their meaning from their context. Other provisions in the statute and the statute as a whole may provide the relevant internal context. They are the words which Parliament has chosen to enact as an expression of the purpose of the legislation and are therefore the primary source by which meaning is ascertained [29]. An important constitutional reason for having regard primarily to the statutory context is that citizens should be able to rely upon what they read in an Act of Parliament [29]. External aids, such as explanatory notes, Law Commission reports, and Government White Papers, must therefore play a secondary role. External aids may assist in identifying the background to a statute, the issue it addresses and its purpose, and the context they disclose may assist in ascertaining the meaning of the statute. But they do not displace the meanings of the words of a statute which are clear and unambiguous in their wider context and which do not produce absurdity [30]. In summary, statutory interpretation involves an objective assessment of the meaning which a reasonable legislature as a body would be seeking to convey in using the statutory words which are being considered [31].Lord Hodge then turns to the appellants\\u2019 submissions. He notes that the appeal is not concerned with fundamental or constitutional common law rights, nor are any Convention rights under the Human Rights Act 1998 engaged [33]. The special rules of construction that are applicable when the principle of legality is infringed or the constitutional right of access to the courts is intruded upon therefore do not apply [33]. The appellants\\u2019 argument based on the constitutional right of access to the courts therefore has no application to the present case [36].The appellants also argued that specific statutory rights are not to be cut down by subordinate legislation passed under the vires of a different Act, a rule identified in the case of R v Secretary of State for Social Security, Ex p Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants [1997] 1 WLR 275 (\\\"JCWI\\\") [34]. Lord Hodge explains that an earlier statute (\\\"statute 1\\\") can be expressly or impliedly amended or repealed by Parliament enacting a later statute (\\\"statute 2\\\"), including by empowering the executive branch of government to make subordinate legislation which impinges upon and even removes rights conferred by statute 1 [40]. Where statute 2 authorises subordinate legislation, the court\\u2019s task is to ascertain the scope of the enabling power contained in statute 2 [40]. In doing so the court will take into account assumptions or presumptions such as the principle of legality [41]. If the court concludes that statute 2 has empowered the executive to make subordinate legislation which has the effect of removing rights conferred by statute 1, the rule inJCWIidentified by the appellants imposes no additional hurdle [42]. And where the court is not dealing with an interference by statute with a common law constitutional right or with a statutory provision which declares such a fundamental or constitutional right, the normal rules of statutory interpretation apply [43].Applying those principles, Lord Hodge concludes that, in the 2014 Act, Parliament authorised the subordinate legislation by which the Secretary of State has fixed the relevant application fee [51]. The appropriateness of imposing the fee on children is a question of policy which is for political determination, and not a matter for the court. The appeal is therefore dismissed [52].Lady Arden agrees with Lord Hodge but explains that she considers there is a wider role in statutory interpretation for pre-legislative materials [58]. Lady Arden observes that the constitutional reason Lord Hodge gives for the courts not using explanatory notes no longer applies insofar as explanatory notes are now often published by commercial publishers and appear online free of charge [59-60]. Lady Arden also considers that there are occasions when pre-legislative material may go further than simply provide the background or context for the statutory provision in question [64-65].

The flats in Settlers Court are held under long leaseholds. The lessees under such long leaseholds are granted the \\\"right to manage\\\" (the \\\"RTM\\\") by Part 2, Chapter 1 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (the \\\"2002 Act\\\"). The RTM permits them to take over management of the block of which their flats form part from the existing manager, whether the landlord or a third party, via a single purpose company (the \\\"RTM Company\\\"). The RTM Company formed by the lessees of the flats in Settlers Court obtained the RTM in respect of Settlers Court on 8 November 2014. That RTM Company is the First Respondent to the appeal. The other Respondents are lessees of flats in Settlers Court.The Estate contains other blocks of flats beyond Settlers Court. These other blocks share facilities and amenities with Settlers Court (the \\\"Estate Facilities\\\"). Prior to the lessees of Settlers Court exercising the RTM, the service of managing the Estate Facilities (the \\\"Estate Services\\\") was provided by a third party manager, the Appellant, for the benefit of the entire Estate. Under the terms of the relevant leases, the Appellant was entitled to levy charges from the lessees on the Estate in respect of providing the Estate Services (the \\\"Estate Charges\\\").A dispute arose between the parties over the extent of the RTM exercised by the lessees of Settlers Court. The Respondents claimed that the statutory RTM extends beyond Settlers Court so as to include the Estate Facilities. These were said to form part of the \\\"premises\\\" over which the RTM is exercisable. Consequently, the RTM Company, not the Appellant, was now responsible for providing the Estate Services to the lessees of Settlers Court and the Appellant was no longer entitled to levy the Estate Charges from them. Instead, once the RTM had been exercised, the Estate Charges in respect of Settlers Court, some 15.2% of the total for the Estate, became payable to the RTM Company not the Appellant.The Appellant disputed this, maintaining that it remained exclusively responsible for providing the Estate Services to the entire Estate because the RTM does not extend beyond the block over which it is exercised (and facilities and amenities solely relating to it). As such, it claimed to be entitled to continue to levy the Estate Charges from the lessees of Settlers Court, noting that it alone continued to provide the Estate Services to the entire Estate pursuant to its obligations under the long leases of flats in blocks other than Settlers Court, which remained in force on any view, and incurred the full costs of doing so.The parties were unable to reach agreement as to how the Estate Facilities should be managed and the Estate Charges levied. On 8 December 2017, the Appellant therefore applied to the First-tier Tribunal (the \\\"F-tT\\\") to determine whether it was entitled to levy Estate Charges from the lessees of the flats in Settlers Court. The F-tT found against the Appellant, considering itself bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal inGala Unity Ltd v Ariadne RoadRTM Co Ltd [2012] EWCA Civ 1372. In that case, the Court of Appeal had decided that the RTM did extend to facilities on an estate which were shared between the block of flats over which the RTM had been exercised and other dwellings, even though this would potentially leave both the RTM Company and the pre-existing manager responsible to different groups of lessees for providing the same services simultaneously. The Upper Tribunal (the \\\"UT\\\") dismissed the Appellant\\u2019s appeal on the basis that, amongst other things, it too was bound byGala Unity. The UT did however issue a leapfrog certificate for an appeal directly to the Supreme Court. This was the first time that the UT has issued such a certificate.JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and, in doing so, holds that Gala Unity was wrongly decided. Lord Briggs gives the sole judgment with which all other members of the Court agree.Reasons for the JudgmentThe RTM grants the RTM Company the right to perform the relevant management functions over \\\"the premises\\\" to the exclusion of any other person such as the existing manager. Treating it as applying to shared common facilities raised insuperable problems [36]. The lessees of flats in blocks other than that over which the RTM has been exercised would be effectively disenfranchised by having shared Estate Services provided by an RTM Company with which they had no formal legal relationship. This would also be contrary to the terms of their leases and was the opposite of what the RTM under the 2002 Act was supposed to achieve[37]-[38].The statutory language in the 2002 Act, which had to be construed in light of the context and purpose of the Act, included numerous signposts pointing against the Estate Facilities forming part of the \\\"premises\\\" over which the RTM was exercisable. As such, the RTM could not grant the RTM Company the right or obligation to provide the Estate Services[39]-[49]. That construction of the 2002 Act was confirmed, but no more than that, by the Consultation Paper which accompanied the draft bill which later became the 2002 Act. This was admissible[51]-[53]. The particular facts ofGala Unityhad served to obscure the real difficulties created by the Court of Appeal\\u2019s decision in that case and the existence of overlapping rights to provide the Estate Services between a manager and an RTM Company[50].The scope of the RTM contended for by the Respondents would lead to outcomes, such as on the facts of the present case, which were both absurd and unworkable. The court would therefore lean against such a construction of the 2002 Act[54]. If the RTM Company was responsible for the Estate Services, it would be entitled to recover Estate Charges only from the lessees of the building in respect of which it had been set up. In this case that would mean only some 15% of the costs of providing the Estate Services could be recovered by the RTM Company. This would likely pose insurmountable solvency issues for it. Conversely, if the existing manager retained responsibility for providing the Estate Services, as it was bound to do under the terms of the leases held by the lessees of buildings other than that over which the RTM had been exercised, it could not recover the costs of doing so from the lessees who had exercised the RTM. In this case, that meant that, absent some agreement with the RTM Company, the Appellant, as manager, could recover only 85% of the costs of providing the Estate Services to the Estate as a whole[56]-[57]. Whilst in some cases the RTM Company and the manager might reach agreement, there was no obligation on an RTM company to do so. It was obviously preferable to interpret the 2002 Act in a way which did not lead to an unworkable situation absent such agreement[58].The RTM under the 2002 Act does not therefore extend to the RTM Company managing the shared Estate Facilities, which do not form part of the \\\"premises\\\" over which the RTM is exercisable. The Appellant remains the sole party responsible for providing the Estate Services to all lessees on the Estate and entitled to levy Estate Charges accordingly, including from the lessees of flats in Settlers Court[62].Gala Unitywas wrongly decided and should be overruled[63].

She has Nigerian citizenship, but from her tenth birthday she has satisfied the requirements to apply for registration as a British citizen under section 1(4) of the British Nationality Act 1981 (the \\\"1981 Act\\\"). O applied to be registered as a British citizen on 15 December 2017 but was unable to afford the full amount of the fee, which was \\u00a3973 at that time [2]. It was not disputed that many children and their families cannot afford the fee charged where an applicant is a child [20]. Because the full fee was not paid, the Secretary of State refused to process O\\u2019s application [2]. O is joined in her challenge by The Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens [4].The Immigration Act 2014 (the \\\"2014 Act\\\") empowers the Secretary of State to set the fees for applications to obtain British citizenship in subordinate legislation, having regard only to the matters listed in section 68(9) of the 2014 Act. Those matters include not only the cost of processing the application but also the benefits that are likely to accrue from obtaining British citizenship and the costs of exercising other functions in relation to immigration and nationality [9-17]. The current level of the fee produces a substantial surplus, over the administrative cost of processing an application to be applied, to subsidise other parts of the immigration and nationality system [3].The appellants challenge the level of the registration fee on the basis that the Secretary of State did not have the power to set the fee at a level which rendered nugatory the underlying statutory right to become a British citizen conferred by the 1981 Act [20-21].JudgmentThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Hodge gives the lead judgment, with whom Lord Briggs, Lord Stephens and Lady Rose agree. Lady Arden gives a concurring judgment.Reasons for the JudgmentLord Hodge explains that the issue on this appeal is one of statutory interpretation: whether Parliament has authorised in primary legislation the imposition by subordinate legislation of the challenged fee [27].Lord Hodge begins by explaining the process of statutory interpretation. By statutory interpretation, the courts are seeking the meaning of the words which Parliament used. Words and passages in a statute derive their meaning from their context. Other provisions in the statute and the statute as a whole may provide the relevant internal context. They are the words which Parliament has chosen to enact as an expression of the purpose of the legislation and are therefore the primary source by which meaning is ascertained [29]. An important constitutional reason for having regard primarily to the statutory context is that citizens should be able to rely upon what they read in an Act of Parliament [29]. External aids, such as explanatory notes, Law Commission reports, and Government White Papers, must therefore play a secondary role. External aids may assist in identifying the background to a statute, the issue it addresses and its purpose, and the context they disclose may assist in ascertaining the meaning of the statute. But they do not displace the meanings of the words of a statute which are clear and unambiguous in their wider context and which do not produce absurdity [30]. In summary, statutory interpretation involves an objective assessment of the meaning which a reasonable legislature as a body would be seeking to convey in using the statutory words which are being considered [31].Lord Hodge then turns to the appellants\\u2019 submissions. He notes that the appeal is not concerned with fundamental or constitutional common law rights, nor are any Convention rights under the Human Rights Act 1998 engaged [33]. The special rules of construction that are applicable when the principle of legality is infringed or the constitutional right of access to the courts is intruded upon therefore do not apply [33]. The appellants\\u2019 argument based on the constitutional right of access to the courts therefore has no application to the present case [36].The appellants also argued that specific statutory rights are not to be cut down by subordinate legislation passed under the vires of a different Act, a rule identified in the case of R v Secretary of State for Social Security, Ex p Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants [1997] 1 WLR 275 (\\\"JCWI\\\") [34]. Lord Hodge explains that an earlier statute (\\\"statute 1\\\") can be expressly or impliedly amended or repealed by Parliament enacting a later statute (\\\"statute 2\\\"), including by empowering the executive branch of government to make subordinate legislation which impinges upon and even removes rights conferred by statute 1 [40]. Where statute 2 authorises subordinate legislation, the court\\u2019s task is to ascertain the scope of the enabling power contained in statute 2 [40]. In doing so the court will take into account assumptions or presumptions such as the principle of legality [41]. If the court concludes that statute 2 has empowered the executive to make subordinate legislation which has the effect of removing rights conferred by statute 1, the rule inJCWIidentified by the appellants imposes no additional hurdle [42]. And where the court is not dealing with an interference by statute with a common law constitutional right or with a statutory provision which declares such a fundamental or constitutional right, the normal rules of statutory interpretation apply [43].Applying those principles, Lord Hodge concludes that, in the 2014 Act, Parliament authorised the subordinate legislation by which the Secretary of State has fixed the relevant application fee [51]. The appropriateness of imposing the fee on children is a question of policy which is for political determination, and not a matter for the court. The appeal is therefore dismissed [52].Lady Arden agrees with Lord Hodge but explains that she considers there is a wider role in statutory interpretation for pre-legislative materials [58].

On that day, the Respondent\\u2019s solicitor stated orally in court that an appeal would be lodged against the extradition order, and on 16 December 2015, the notice of application for leave to appeal was filed with the Court. However, due to an oversight, the solicitor failed to serve the notice on the Crown Solicitor\\u2019s Office (on behalf of Greece) until about three weeks later.Section 26(5) of the Extradition Act 2003 provides that where a person gives notice of application for leave to appeal against an extradition order after the end of the permitted period (which is seven days from the date of the relevant order), the High Court must not for that reason refuse to entertain the application if the person did \\\"everything reasonably possible to ensure that the notice was given as soon as it could be given.\\\"The Divisional Court in England and Wales inSzegfu v Court of Pecs, Hungary[2015] EWHC 1764 (Admin) had indicated that the correct interpretation of section 26(5) permitted no distinction between the conduct of the person and the conduct of their legal representative, so that the legal representative\\u2019s conduct was to be attributed to the person with the consequence that if the legal representative had not done everything reasonably possible to ensure that the notice was given as soon as it could be given, the High Court should not entertain the application for leave to appeal. In this case, the Divisional Court in Northern Ireland disagreed with the interpretation inSzegfuand found that it was not necessary to hold a person responsible for any failings on the part of his legal representatives. The Divisional Court in Northern Ireland decided to entertain Mr O\\u2019Connor\\u2019s application for leave to appeal, notwithstanding that it was made out of time. The Appellant now appeals that decision.The question for the Supreme Court to decide is whether section 26(5) should be interpreted to allow or exclude a distinction between the actions of a person and their legal representative.JudgmentThe Supreme Court dismisses the appeal. Lord Stephens gives the judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.Reasons for the JudgmentSection 26(1) of the Extradition Act 2003 identifies a \\\"person\\\" as being the person who is subject to an extradition order. In section 26(5), the word \\\"person\\\" appears twice. Lord Stephens finds that on both occurrences, \\\"person\\\" means the person subject to an extradition order, as set out in section 26(1). In the second occurrence of the word, the requirement of doing everything reasonably possible is imposed by the language of the provision only on \\\"the person\\\" and there is no evident reason to understand it as also being imposed on the individual\\u2019s agent or legal representative. [48]This interpretation is supported by considering the vice sought to be addressed by Parliament when inserting section 26(5) into the Extradition Act 2003. The vice was the potential for substantial injustice caused by the application of short and rigid time limits for those seeking to appeal against extradition orders, whether or not such persons had legal representation. [49]The surrogacy principle involves the imputation of the fault of a client\\u2019s legal representative to that client. However, the surrogacy principle is not universal. Lord Stephens finds that the surrogacy principle does not require an interpretation of section 26(5) consistent with the Divisional Court\\u2019s view inSzegfu. [50]Lord Stephens agrees with the Divisional Court in this case, in finding that the procedural unfairness of attributing the fault of the legal representative to the client may not be remedied in practice, because even if it is open to the client to sue his legal representative in negligence, that right will not be of little assistance in circumstances where the client has been extradited to a place where he is at risk of inhuman and degrading treatment. [51]Accordingly, Lord Stephens departs from the interpretation of section 26(5) inSzegfu[52], and dismisses the Appellant\\u2019s appeal.

As Lord Phillips stated, even if such a challenge was not possible, it might still be open for the OFT to assess the fairness of the charges according to other criteria (Para 61). \\uf0b7  The key issue was whether the charges constituted the \\u2018price and remuneration\\u2019 as against \\u2018the goods or services supplied in exchange\\u2019 within the meaning of the Regulations. The Supreme Court considered and decided a number of arguments as to whether the charges could be said to be \\u2018price or remuneration\\u2019 under Regulation 6 (2) (b): (1)  The  charges  were  not  paid  \\u2018in  exchange\\u2019  for  the  transactions  to  which  they  related  \\u2013  eg. honouring a cheque when the customer had insufficient funds to do so (Para 75). (2)  The Court of Appeal was wrong to find that Regulation 6 (2) (b) did not apply to charges that were \\u2018ancillary\\u2019 to the core contract between the bank and customer (Paras 38-41, 47, 78, 112). Lord  Walker  commented  that  Regulation  6  (2)  (b)  contained  no  indication  that  only  the \\u2018essential\\u2019  price  or  remuneration  was  relevant.  In  fact,  any  monetary  price  or  remuneration payable  under  the  contract  would  naturally  fall  within  the  language  of  Regulation    6  (2)  (b) (Para 41). (3)  The  charges  were  not  concealed  default  charges  designed  to  discourage  customers  from becoming overdrawn on their accounts without prior arrangement (Paras 88, 114). The High Court had rejected this argument and was right to do so. (4)  The charges were properly to be regarded as falling within the scope of the Regulations (Paras 43,  80,  104).  They  were  in  fact  part  of  the  price  or  remuneration  paid  by  the  customer  in exchange  for  the  package  of  services  which  made  up  a  current  account  (Paras  47,  89).  The fact  that  liability  to  pay  the  charges  depended  on  specific  events  occurring  was  irrelevant  to that conclusion (Paras 47, 104). \\uf0b7  Accordingly,  since  any  assessment  of  the  fairness  of  the  charges,    which  related  to  their appropriateness as against the services supplied in exchange, fell within Regulation 6 (2) (b), no such assessment could take place and so the appeal would be allowed (Paras 51, 90, 92, 118, 119).  Further Comments \\uf0b7  Lord  Phillips  also  noted  that  in  the  absence  of  the  charges  the  banks  would  not  be  able profitably to provide current account services without a fee (Para 88). He stated that it might be  open  to  question  whether  it  is  fair  to  subsidise  some  customers  whose  accounts  always remain  in  credit  by  levies  on  others  who  experienced  events  they  did  not  foresee  when  they opened their accounts (Para 80). \\uf0b7  Lord Walker commented that ministers and Parliament had decided to transpose the directive as  it  stood  rather  than  to  confer  the  higher  degree  of  consumer  protection  afforded  by  the national  laws  of  some  other  member  states.  Parliament  might  wish  to  consider  whether  to revisit that decision (Para 52). Lord Mance endorsed this comment (Para 118).

She questioned whether the real problem was not the charging model, but the lack of competition between the banks as to the product they offered (Para 93).   No Reference to European Court of Justice \\uf0b7  The  court  decided  that  although  the  interpretation  of  the  European  directive  which  the Regulations  implemented  was  a  question  of  European  law  it  was  not  necessary  to  refer  the matter to the European Court of Justice (Paras 49, 91, 115, 120).

(Paras  [25]-[29];  [44]\\u2013[46]) In a case such as this where no certification has been given under s 94 (providing for the exclusion of appeals that are clearly unfounded) or s 96 (removing the right of appeal if the claim raises an issue  which  has  been  or  ought  to  have  been  dealt  with  in  an  earlier  appeal),  there  is  no  need  to impose a further requirement which is not mentioned elsewhere in the 2002 Act, namely that the words \\u201ca\\u2026claim\\u201d  exclude a further  claim which has not been held under rule 353 to be a fresh claim. (Para [29]) \\uf0b7  The Appellant\\u2019s construction risks undermining the beneficial objects of the Refugee Convention, as it would exclude, by s 95, claims which the Secretary of State considers not to be fresh claims from  the  ground  of  appeal  in  s  84(1)(g),  when  claims  which  are  certified  as  clearly  unfounded under s 94 would still be given the benefit of that section. (Section 84(1)(g) provides for an appeal where  removal  would  place  the  UK  in  breach  of  its  international  or  human  rights  obligations.) (Paras [30]\\u2013[32]; [47]) \\uf0b7  Rule 353 does not affect the operation of the legislative scheme, which provides the complete code for dealing with repeat claims. (Para [33])  Lady Hale, dissenting, would have allowed the appeal. \\uf0b7  Lady Hale concluded \\u201ca\\u2026claim\\u201d in s 92(4)(a) of the 2002 Act ought to be given the same meaning ascribed  to the phrase in the 1993 Act  in  Onibiyo. There was no need for it to be defined in the 2002  Act  given  it  had  already  been  judicially  interpreted.  (Paras  [39]\\u2013[40])  The  addition  of sections 94 and 96 should not be taken to mean that Parliament had abandoned the old meaning of \\u201cclaim\\u201d without expressly saying so, particularly as the additional sections are not apt to cater for repetitious claims. (Paras [41]\\u2013[42]) \\uf0b7  Lady  Hale  disagreed  that  the  Appellant\\u2019s  construction  would  undermine  the  UK\\u2019s  international obligations. A person who presents a repeat claim on asylum or human rights grounds has already enjoyed the right of appeal on these grounds within this country. The current system allowing for an  initial  decision  followed  by  an  appeal  system  in  the  UK  is  sufficient  compliance  with  those obligations.
